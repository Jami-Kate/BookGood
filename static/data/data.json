The concluding Mike Hammer novel begins with a 21st-century funeral before flashing back to the summer of 1973. Nine years after the events of Dig Two Graves, Hammer takes another unlikely vacation --- this time on Long Island to help look after his partner Velda Sterling\u2019s 17-year-old sibling, Mikki. Mikki must deal with the attention of two boys vying for her affection --- Hammer preferring the good kid from a wealthy family over the long-haired doper with an Easy Rider vibe. When Mikki gets hooked on heroin, Hammer --- filled with contempt for dope dealers --- goes on a rampage. He will find those behind the drug racket and teach them what shooting up is all about. But a final resolution awaits him in the future at that funeral.",

Recently divorced and slightly heavy-handed with his liquor, Bowie does all that he can to cope with the actions taken (or not taken) during the investigation of Crissy Mellin, a teenage girl who disappeared more than three years prior. But now, \"Crisis Point,\" a long-running true crime television series, is soon to air an episode documenting the unsolved Mellin case. Bowie has been instructed by his unscrupulous boss to keep to himself his grievances and criticisms over the mishandling of the investigation.\n\t\u00a0\n\tBeth Collins, a senior producer on \"Crisis Point,\" knows what classifies as a great story and when there\u2019s something more to be told. After working on the show for seven years researching, fact-checking and editing dozens of episodes, Collins is convinced that Crissy Mellin\u2019s disappearance was not an isolated incident. A string of disappearances of teenage girls in nearby areas has only one thing in common: They took place on the night of a blood moon. In a last-ditch effort to find out the truth, Beth leaves New York City for Louisiana to enlist Detective Bowie in helping her figure out what happened to Crissy and find the true culprit before he acts on the next blood moon --- in four days\u2019 time.\n\t\u00a0\n\tAt the risk of their careers, credibility and very lives, Bowie and Collins band together to identify and capture a canny perpetrator, while fighting an irresistible spark between them that threatens to upend everything.",

            "review": " A read-in-one-night suspense thriller narrated by a compulsive liar whose little white lies allow her to enter into the life and comfort of a wealthy married couple who are harboring much darker secrets themselves. For the millions of us still chasing those gone girls, this is perfect for fans of Lisa Jewell, Lucy Foley and Laura Dave. Sloane Caraway is a liar. Harmless lies, mostly, to make her self-proclaimed sad, little life a bit more interesting. So when Sloane sees a young girl in tears at a park one afternoon, she can\u2019t help herself. She tells the girl\u2019s (very attractive) dad that she\u2019s a nurse and helps him pull a bee stinger from the girl\u2019s foot. With this lie, and chance encounter, Sloane becomes the nanny for the wealthy and privileged Jay and Violet Lockhart. They\u2019re the perfect New York couple, with a brownstone, a daughter in private school, and summers on Block Island. But maybe Sloane isn\u2019t the only one lying, and all that\u2019s picture-perfect harbors a much more dangerous truth. To say anything more is to spoil the most exciting, twisty and bitingly smart suspense novel to come out in years. The thing about lies is that they add up, form their own truth and a twisted prison of a world. And in COUNT MY LIES, Sophie Stava spins a breakneck, unputdownable thriller about the secrets we keep and the terrifying dangers that lurk just under the images we spend so much time trying to maintain. Careful what you lie for.",

Chiamaka is a Nigerian travel writer living in America. Alone in the midst of the pandemic, she recalls her past lovers and grapples with her choices and regrets. Zikora, her best friend, is a lawyer who has been successful at everything until --- betrayed and brokenhearted --- she must turn to the person she thought she needed least. Omelogor, Chiamaka\u2019s bold, outspoken cousin, is a financial powerhouse in Nigeria who begins to question how well she knows herself. And Kadiatou, Chiamaka\u2019s housekeeper, is proudly raising her daughter in America --- but faces an unthinkable hardship that threatens all she has worked to achieve. In DREAM COUNT, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie trains her fierce eye on these women in a sparkling, transcendent novel that takes up the very nature of love itself. Is true happiness ever attainable, or is it just a fleeting state? And how honest must we be with ourselves in order to love, and to be loved? A trenchant reflection on the choices we make and those made for us, on daughters and mothers, on our interconnected world, DREAM COUNT pulses with emotional urgency and poignant, unflinching observations of the human heart, in language that soars with beauty and power. It confirms Adichie\u2019s status as one of the most exciting and dynamic writers on the literary landscape.",

            "review": " A fun and fascinating social history of the famed Katharine Gibbs School, which, from the 1910s to the 1960s, trained women for executive secretary positions but surreptitiously was instilling the self-confidence and strategic know-how necessary for them to claim equality, power and authority in the wider world. \n\t\u00a0\n\tIt\u2019s a safe bet that most of the secretaries on the TV series \u201cMad Men\u201d would have attended the Katharine Gibbs School in New York City. In its heyday in the 1950s and \u201860s, the iconic institution was synonymous with supplying secretaries --- always properly attired in heels, ladylike hats and white gloves --- to male executives. In EXPECT GREAT THINGS!, Vanda Krefft turns the notion of a \u201cGibbs girl\u201d on its head, showing us that while the school was getting women who could type 90 words per minute into the C-suite, its more subversive mission was to get them out of the secretarial pool to assume positions of power on the other side of the desk. And Gibbs graduates did just that, tackling the sexism of the era and paving the way for 21st-century women to succeed in any profession. Katharine Gibbs was one her own success stories. She started her school when, as a 46-year-old widow, she was left near-broke with two young sons. The school taught typing and stenography, but Gibbs also hired accomplished professors from elite colleges to teach academic subjects. It was a well-rounded education that produced early feminists ready to tackle the sexism of their era. \"Expect great things!\" was her motto and her philosophy. Within a decade she\u2019d opened schools in three elegant locations. With nostalgic period photographs throughout, EXPECT GREAT THINGS! takes us back to Katie Gibbs\u2019 life and tells the stories of the women she influenced. We meet Gibbs graduates who worked for the Walt Disney, Marilyn Monroe and Robert F. Kennedy. Others forged pathfinding roles as an Emmy-winning television star, a women\u2019s rights advisor to four U.S. presidents, a writer of Wonder Woman comic books, the head of the Women\u2019s Marines, a bestselling young adult author and a U.S. Ambassador. For readers of THE BARBIZON and COME FLY THE WORLD, EXPECT GREAT THINGS! reveals the seismic impact the Katharine Gibbs school had on the American workplace --- and on women\u2019s opportunities today.",

Finlay Donovan and her nanny/partner-in-crime, Vero, have not always gotten along with Finlay\u2019s elderly neighbor, Mrs. Haggerty, the community busybody and president of the neighborhood watch. But when a dead body is discovered in her backyard, Mrs. Haggerty needs their help. At first a suspect, Mrs. Haggerty is cleared by the police, but her house remains an active crime scene. She has nowhere to go...except Finlay\u2019s house, right across the street. Finlay and Vero have no interest in getting involved in another murder case --- or sacrificing either of their bedrooms. After all, they\u2019ve dealt with enough murders over the last four months to last a lifetime, and they both would much rather share their beds with someone else. But when the focus of the investigation widens to include Finlay\u2019s ex-husband, Steven, Finlay and Vero are left with little choice but to get closer to Mrs. Haggerty and uncover her secrets\u2026before the police start digging up theirs.

Discovering the works of Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, she finally sees herself and her loved ones reflected in their stories of \u201cmessy, beautiful, joyful Black people.\u201d Interwoven with Bernice's personal journey is her family's history, beginning with her four-times enslaved great-grandmother Louisa Vicey Wilson in 1822 Hancock County, Georgia. Her descendants survived Reconstruction and Jim Crow, joined the Great Migration, and mourned Dr. King\u2019s assassination during the Civil Rights Movement. These women's wisdom, secrets and fierce love are passed down like Louisa's handmade quilt. A memoir of many threads, FIRSTBORN GIRLS is an extraordinarily moving portrait of a life shaped by family, history and the drive to be something more.",

            "review": " A secretive vigilante group called Edge cleanses Galway of its worst criminals. But when someone starts picking off Edge members, private detective Jack Taylor steps in to investigate. Edge, a shadow organization made up of the most powerful figures in Galway society, exists to rid the city of criminals and abusers who have evaded the law. Long wary of the organization, the Vatican is not pleased when rumors start swirling that one of the Catholic Church\u2019s own priests has joined its ranks. And who better to ask to intercede than the whiskey-swigging ex-cop who always seems to have one foot in the pub and another among Ireland\u2019s clergy? Lately, Jack has been spending his days sitting at the bedside of a man he put into a coma and taking care of a little dog named Trip, bequeathed to him by a dead nun. Then an envoy to the Archdiocese shows up at his door, asking Jack to go speak to a priest named Kevin Whelan and dissuade him from any involvement with Edge. Jack accepts the mission, but the next day Father Whelan is found dead, hanging from a rope in his own backyard. Would Edge really kill one of their own? And if not, who else would be bold enough to take on the most powerful organization in the city? As more Edge members are murdered, the Vatican grows alarmed that someone even worse will take their place. It\u2019s up to Jack Taylor to nail the culprit before Edge is dissolved completely and Galway is thrown into chaos.",

It's July 1992, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland are still grinding on after 25 apocalyptic years. Detective Inspector Sean Duffy got his family safely over the water to Scotland, to \"Shortbread Land.\" Duffy is a part-timer now, only returning to Belfast six days a month to get his pension.

Based on true events, Duffy must unentangle parallel operations by the CIA, MI5 and Special Branch.

            "review": " From the award-winning author of FLUX comes a dazzling novel about love, family and the art of sushi that asks: What if you could return to the point of a fateful choice, wiser than before, and find the courage to forge a new path? A coma can change a man, but the world Jack Jr. awakens to is one he barely recognizes. His advertising job is history, his Manhattan apartment is gone, and the love of his life has left him behind. He\u2019s been asleep for two years; with no one to turn to, he realizes it\u2019s been 10 years since he last saw his family. Lost and disoriented, he makes a reluctant homecoming back to the bustling Korean American enclave of Fort Lee, New Jersey; back into the waiting arms of his parents, who are operating under the illusion that he never left; and back to Joja, their ever-struggling sushi restaurant that he was set to inherit before he ran away from it all. As he steps back into the life he abandoned --- learning his Appa\u2019s life lessons over crates of tuna on bleary-eyed 4am fish runs, doling out amberjack behind the omakase counter while his Umma tallies the night\u2019s pitiful number of customers, and sparring with his recovering alcoholic brother, James --- he embraces new roles, too: that of romantic interest to the nurse who took care of him, and that of sage (but underqualified) uncle to his gangly teenage nephew. There is value in the joyous rhythms of this once-abandoned life. But second chances are an even messier business than running a restaurant, and the lure of a self-determined path once again might prove too hard to resist. Why do we run from those we love, and why do we still love those who run from us? A highly entertaining and poignant story about second chances and self-discovery, I LEAVE IT UP TO YOU navigates loss, love and the absurdity of finding one\u2019s footing after the ground gives way.",

After more than a year of laying low, Billie, Helen, Mary Alice and Natalie are called back into action. They have enjoyed their time off, but the lack of excitement is starting to chafe: a professional killer can only take so many watercolor classes and yoga sessions without itching to strangle someone...literally. When they receive a summons from the head of the elite assassin organization known as the Museum, they are ready tackle the greatest challenge of their careers. Someone on the inside has compiled a list of important kills committed by Museum agents, connected to a single, shadowy figure, an Eastern European gangster with an iron fist, some serious criminal ambition, and a tendency to kill first and ask questions later. This new nemesis is murdering agents who got in the way of their power-hungry plans, and the aging quartet of killers is next. Together the foursome embark on a wild ride across the globe on the double mission of rooting out the Museum\u2019s mole and hunting down the gangster who seems to know their next move before they make it.

Marlene Dietrich, the German-American actress and singer, was of course one of the biggest stars of the 20th century.

Working in the European theater, across enemy lines in occupied China, and in Washington, D.C., Betty, Zuzka, Jane and Marlene forged letters and \u201cofficial\u201d military orders, wrote and produced entire newspapers, scripted radio broadcasts and songs, and even developed rumors for undercover spies and double agents to spread to the enemy.

            "review": " A moving and fascinating meditation on freedom, trust, loss and our relationship with the natural world, explored through the story of one woman\u2019s unlikely friendship with a wild hare. Imagine you could hold a baby hare and bottle-feed it. Imagine that it lived under your roof and lolloped around your bedroom at night, drumming on the duvet cover when it wanted your attention. Imagine that, over two years later, it still ran in from the fields when you called it, slept in your house for hours on end, and gave birth to leverets in your study. For political advisor and speechwriter Chloe Dalton, who spent lockdown deep in the English countryside, far away from her usual busy London life, this became her unexpected reality. In February 2021, Dalton stumbles upon a newborn hare --- a leveret --- that had been chased by a dog. Fearing for its life, she brings it home, only to discover how impossible it is to rear a wild hare, most of whom perish in captivity from either shock or starvation. Through trial and error, she learns to feed and care for the leveret with every intention of returning it to the wilderness. Instead, it becomes her constant companion, wandering the fields and woods at night and returning to Dalton\u2019s house by day. Though Dalton feared that the hare would be preyed upon by foxes, stoats, feral cats, raptors and even people, she never tried to restrict it to the house. Each time the hare leaves, Chloe knows she may never see it again. Yet she also understands that to confine it would be its own kind of death. RAISING HARE chronicles their journey together, while also taking a deep dive into the lives and nature of hares, and the way they have been viewed historically in art, literature and folklore. We witness firsthand the joy at this extraordinary relationship between human and animal, which serves as a reminder that the best things, and most beautiful experiences, arise when we least expect them.",

Growing up on his family\u2019s cattle farm in western Iceland, young Orri has gained an appreciation for the beauty found in everyday things: the cavorting of a newborn calf, the return of birdsong after a long winter, the steadfast love of a good (or tolerably good) farm dog. But the outer world still beckons, so Orri leaves his no-nonsense Lithuanian Jewish mother and his taciturn father, Pabbi, to attend university in Reykjav\u00edk.\n\t\u00a0\n\tPabbi is no stranger to cycles of life and death, growth and destruction. He is pursued by the memory of a volcanic eruption and its aftermath, and so many years of hardscrabble farming have left their mark. Jaded, and no longer able to find joy in his way of life, Pabbi falls into a depression soon after Orri goes away to school. Orri, feeling adrift and aimless at the end of his first semester, comes home.\n\t\u00a0\n\tFor the first time, Pabbi allows Orri to help him run the farm.

But Richard Nicolls, the military officer who led the English flotilla bent on destruction, changed his strategy once he encountered Peter Stuyvesant, New Netherland\u2019s canny director general. Bristling with vibrant characters, TAKING MANHATTAN reveals the founding of New York to be an invention, the result of creative negotiations that would blend the multiethnic, capitalistic society of New Amsterdam with the power of the rising English empire. But the birth of what might be termed the first modern city is also a story of the brutal dispossession of Native Americans and of the roots of American slavery. The book draws from newly translated materials and illuminates neglected histories --- of religious refugees, Indigenous tribes, and free and enslaved Africans. TAKING MANHATTAN tells the riveting story of the birth of New York City as a center of capitalism and pluralism, a foundation from which America would rise. It also shows how the paradox of New York\u2019s origins --- boundless opportunity coupled with subjugation and displacement --- reflects America\u2019s promise and failure to this day. Russell Shorto, whose work has been described as \u201castonishing\u201d (New York Times) and \u201cliterary alchemy\u201d (Chicago Tribune), has once again mined archival sources to offer a vibrant tale and a fresh and trenchant argument about American beginnings.",

            "review": " From Laila Lalami --- the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award finalist and a \u201cmaestra of literary fiction\u201d (NPR) --- comes a riveting and utterly original novel about one woman\u2019s fight for freedom, set in a near future where even dreams are under surveillance. Sara has just landed at LAX, returning home from a conference abroad, when agents from the Risk Assessment Administration pull her aside and inform her that she will soon commit a crime. Using data from her dreams, the RAA\u2019s algorithm has determined that she is at imminent risk of harming the person she loves most: her husband. For his safety, she must be kept under observation for 21 days. The agents transfer Sara to a retention center, where she is held with other dreamers, all of them women trying to prove their innocence from different crimes. With every deviation from the strict and ever-shifting rules of the facility, their stay is extended. Months pass, and Sara seems no closer to release. Then one day, a new resident arrives, disrupting the order of the facility and leading Sara on a collision course with the very companies that have deprived her of her freedom. Eerie, urgent and ceaselessly clear-eyed, THE DREAM HOTEL artfully explores the seductive nature of technology, which puts us in shackles even as it makes our lives easier. Lalami asks how much of ourselves must remain private if we are to remain free, and whether even the most invasive forms of surveillance can ever capture who we really are.",

At the start of a new century, a shocking murder transfixes Manhattan, forcing bitter rivals Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr to work together to save a man from the gallows. Just before Christmas 1799, Elma Sands slips out of her Quaker cousin\u2019s boarding house --- and doesn\u2019t come home. Has she eloped? Run away? No one knows --- until her body appears in the Manhattan Well. Her family insists they know who killed her. Handbills circulate around the city accusing a carpenter named Levi Weeks of seducing and murdering Elma. But privately, quietly, Levi\u2019s wealthy brother calls in a special favor. Aaron Burr\u2019s legal practice can\u2019t finance both his expensive tastes and his ambition to win the 1800 New York elections. To defend Levi Weeks is a double win: a hefty fee plus a chance to grab headlines. Alexander Hamilton has his own political aspirations; he isn\u2019t going to let Burr monopolize the public\u2019s attention. If Burr is defending Levi Weeks, then Hamilton will too. As the trial and the election draw near, Burr and Hamilton race against time to save a man\u2019s life --- and destroy each other. Part murder mystery, part thriller, part true crime, THE GIRL FROM GREENWICH STREET revisits a dark corner of history --- with a surprising twist ending that reveals the true story of the woman at the center of the tale.",

            "review": " The first major biography of legendary Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver --- who has been described as \u201cthe Copernicus of baseball\u201d and \u201cthe grandfather of the modern game\u201d --- THE LAST MANAGER is a wild, thrilling and hilarious ride with baseball\u2019s most underappreciated genius, and one of its greatest characters. Long before the Moneyball Era, the Earl of Baltimore reigned over baseball. History\u2019s feistiest and most colorful manager, Earl Weaver transformed the sport by collecting and analyzing data in visionary ways, ultimately winning more games than anybody else during his time running the Orioles from 1968 to 1982. When Weaver was hired by the Orioles, managers were still seen as coaches and inspirational leaders, more teachers of the game than strategists. Weaver invented new ways of building baseball teams, prioritizing on-base average, elite defense and strike throwing. Weaver was the first manager to use a modern radar gun, and he pioneered the use of analytical data. By moving six-foot four-inch Cal Ripken Jr. to shortstop, Weaver paved the way for a generation of plus-sized superstar shortstops, such as Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter. He foreshadowed almost everything that Bill James, Billy Beane, Theo Epstein and hundreds of other big-brain baseball types would later present as innovations. Beyond being a great baseball mind, Weaver was a rare baseball character. Major League Baseball is show business, and Weaver understood how much of his job was entertainment. Weaver\u2019s legendary outbursts offered players cathartic relief from their own frustration, signaled his concern for the team, and fired up fans. In his frequent arguments with umpires, he hammed it up for the crowds, faked heart attacks, ripped bases out of the ground, and pretended to toss umpires out of the game. Weaver also fought with his players, especially Jim Palmer, but that creative tension contributed to stunning success and a hilarious clubhouse. During his tenure as major-league manager, the Orioles won the American League pennant in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1979, each time winning more than 100 games. THE LAST MANAGER uncovers the story of Weaver\u2019s St. Louis childhood with a mobster uncle, his years of minor-league heartbreak, and his unlikely road to becoming a big-league manager, while tracing the evolution of the game from the old-time baseball of cross-country trains and \u201cdesk contracts\u201d to the modern era of free agency, video analysis and powerful player agents. Weaver\u2019s career is a critical juncture in baseball history. He was the only manager to hold a job during the five years leading up to and the five years after free agency upended the sport in 1976. Weaver was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. \u201cNo manager belongs there more,\u201d wrote Tom Boswell. \u201cWeaver encapsulates the fire, the humor, the brains, the childishness, the wisdom and the goofy fun of baseball.\u201d THE LAST MANAGER tells the story of one man --- belligerent, genius, infamous --- who left his mark on the game for generations.",

            "review": " A darkly funny, life-affirming debut novel following five women from a once illustrious Iranian family as they grapple with revolutions personal and political. Meet the Valiat family. In Iran, they were somebodies. In America, they\u2019re nobodies. First there is Elizabeth, the regal matriarch with the famously large nose, who remained in Tehran despite the revolution. She lives alone but is sometimes visited by Niaz, her Islamic-law-breaking granddaughter, who takes her partying with a side of purpose and yet manages to survive. Elizabeth\u2019s daughters wound up in America: Shirin, a charismatic and flamboyantly high-flying event planner in Houston, who considers herself the family\u2019s future, and Seema, a dreamy idealist turned housewife languishing in the chaparral-filled hills of Los Angeles. And then there\u2019s the other granddaughter, Bita, a disillusioned law student in New York City trying to find deeper meaning by quietly giving away her belongings. When an annual vacation in Aspen goes wildly awry and Shirin ends up in jail, the family\u2019s upper-class veneer is cracked open. Shirin embarks upon a quest to restore the family name to its former glory, but what does that mean in a country where the Valiats never mattered? Can they bring their old inheritance into a new tomorrow? By turns satirical and philosophical, spanning from 1940s Iran to a splintered 2000s, THE PERSIANS upends the reader\u2019s expectations while exploring questions about love, family, money, art, and how to find yourself and each other when your country is lost. Wry and witty, brazen and absurd, THE PERSIANS is a deeply moving reinvention of the American family saga.",

When wildlife biologist Alex Carter is tasked with locating jaguars on a vast desert preserve in New Mexico, she is ecstatic. While jaguars once roamed throughout the Southwest, they are now endangered, with only a handful remaining, and Alex hopes that some of the sleek and elusive creatures have found their way to the protected sanctuary. Meanwhile, an archaeological team is excavating the gravesite of a 16th-century Spanish conquistador on a neighboring piece of land. Curious about the dig, Alex meets the team. While learning about their discoveries, she encounters a dangerous group of anti-immigrant vigilantes roaming the area, threatening the team and demanding they leave. And when the militants learn of Alex\u2019s mission, they become bent on stopping her. Because jaguars are federally endangered, the vigilantes worry that if Alex finds them, concessions will be made so that wildlife can cross the border wall. And they want no one crossing it. And then there are the strange holes that keep appearing on the preserve. Who is digging them, and what are they looking for? As tensions mount, Alex soon finds herself in a fight for her life against those who would prevent her from restoring jaguars to their historical habitat.",

            "review": " An outstanding debut novel --- a love story, mystery and philosophical puzzle, told in the singular voices of the residents of a Beaux Arts apartment house in Belgium during World War II. On the eve of the Nazi occupation, in the heart of Brussels, life for the residents of 33 Place Brugmann is about to change forever. Charlotte Sauvin, an art student raised by her beloved architect father in apartment 4L, knows all the details of the building and its people: how light falls on wood floors and voices echo off the marble staircase, the distinct knock of her dear friend, Julian Rapha\u00ebl, the son of the art dealer\u2019s family across the hall. Then the Rapha\u00ebls disappear, leaving everything behind but their priceless art collection, which has simply vanished. All else that\u2019s familiar fractures when whispers of German occupation become reality, and the lives of the residents grow increasingly intertwined. Charlotte\u2019s godmother Masha, a beautiful seamstress living upstairs, deepens her risky affair with a wartime compatriot of Colonel Warlemont in 3L --- a man far more calculating than his neighbors believe. When a Nazi functionary with an interest in the Rapha\u00ebls moves into the building, knowing who can and cannot be trusted becomes a matter of life and death. In the face of their perilous new reality, every member of this accidental community will discover they are not the person they believed themself to be. When confronted with a cruel choice --- submit to the regime or risk their lives to save one another --- each learns the truth about what, and who, matters to them the most. A propulsive and exquisitely written tour de force, 33 PLACE BRUGMANN champions the restorative power of love, courage and art in times of great threat.",

In this moving, hilarious and insightful memoir, Laurie Woolever traces her path from a small-town childhood to working at revered restaurants and food publications, alternately bolstered and overshadowed by two of the most powerful men in the business. But there\u2019s more to the story than the two bold-faced names on her resume: Mario Batali and Anthony Bourdain. Behind the scenes, Laurie\u2019s life is frequently chaotic, an often pleasurable buffet of bad decisions at which she frequently overstays her welcome. Acerbic and wryly self-deprecating, Laurie attempts to carve her own space as a woman in this world that is by turns toxic and intoxicating. Laurie seeks to try it all --- from a seedy Atlantic City strip club to the Park Hyatt Tokyo, from a hippie vegetarian co-op to the legendary El Bulli --- while balancing her consuming work with her sometimes ambivalent relationship to marriage and motherhood. As the food world careens toward an overdue reckoning and Laurie\u2019s mentors face their own high-profile descents, she is confronted with the questions of where she belongs and how to hold on to the parts of her life\u2019s work that she truly values: care and feeding.",

One of the most iconic structures in the Four Lands is Paranor, the fortress home of the Druid Order. Legend holds that it was erected by an Elven leader known as Galaphile Joss. But who was this Galaphile, and how and why did he choose to establish this center of magic and learning? Within these pages we meet the real Galaphile, following him from a friendless teenage orphan stranded in the Human world to a powerful adult and master mage, studying under the infamous recluse, Cogline. We learn of the forces that shaped him --- those he loved and those he lost; those who aided him and those who stood against him. Throughout it all, Galaphile\u2019s goal is a noble one: to bring order to a chaotic world, and to make life better for those trying to survive it. To this end, he commences building the citadel which will one day be known as Paranor with the aid of the King of the Silver River. But there is one other who seeks dominion over the Four Lands --- and for far less virtuous ends. For this foe has been corrupted by an ancient evil --- one that will not only reach out and touch Galaphile\u2019s nearest and dearest, but also echo down through the centuries, sowing the seeds for some of the darkest times the Four Lands will ever face.",

Jane and Dan have been married for 19 years, but Jane isn\u2019t sure they\u2019re going to make it to 20. The mother of two feels unneeded by her teenagers, and her writing career has screeched to an unsuccessful halt. Her one published novel sold under 500 copies. Worse? She\u2019s pretty sure Dan is cheating on her. When the couple goes to the renowned upscale restaurant La Fin du Monde to celebrate their anniversary, Jane thinks it\u2019s as good a place as any to tell Dan she wants a divorce. But before they even get to the second course, an underground climate activist group bursts into the dining room. Jane is shocked --- and not just because she\u2019s in a hostage situation the likes of which she\u2019s only seen in the movies. Nearly everything the disorganized and bumbling activists say and do is right out of the pages of her failed book. Even Dan (who Jane wasn\u2019t sure even read her book) admits it\u2019s eerily familiar. Which means Dan and Jane are the only ones who know what\u2019s going to happen next. And they\u2019re the only ones who can stop it. This wasn\u2019t what Jane was thinking of when she said \u201c\u2019til death do us part\u201d all those years ago, but if they can survive this, maybe they can survive anything --- even marriage.",

With a newborn and two children, Molly Murphy Sullivan is tackling motherhood. Her husband, Daniel, is off to work in Washington as Easter break begins in New York. Her dear friend and writer, Ryan O\u2019Hara, is shooting a movie, one of the first to involve a real plot and actors. He invites Molly and the children to visit the set and watch the excitement. When one of the actresses is fired, Molly\u2019s adopted daughter, Bridie, is called to replace her in the scene. Turns out she\u2019s a natural and is asked to star in the rest of the film. Molly is skeptical about leaving Bridie alone on set, but her great friends, Sid and Gus, offer to chaperone her. The movie industry is still experimenting with ways to get the best shot, like pretending to tie Bridie to real train tracks. But soon, their special effects start to malfunction. After a few mishaps where no one is hurt, the special effects turn deadly. With rumors of a feud between studios, Molly believes these malfunctions are sabotage. She is invited to go undercover on set to investigate the burgeoning film war. Once again, Rhys Bowen and Clare Broyles deliver an engaging mystery full of vibrant historical details and thrilling escapades featuring one of mystery's most beloved sleuths.",

            "review": " From Pulitzer finalist, MacArthur Fellowship recipient and bestselling author of SWAMPLANDIA! and VAMPIRES IN THE LEMON GROVE Karen Russell: a gripping dust bowl epic about five characters whose fates become entangled after a storm ravages their small Nebraskan town. THE ANTIDOTE opens on Black Sunday, as a historic dust storm ravages the fictional town of Uz, Nebraska. But Uz is already collapsing --- not just under the weight of the Great Depression and the dust bowl drought, but beneath its own violent histories. The novel follows a \"Prairie Witch,\u201d whose body serves as a bank vault for peoples\u2019 memories and secrets; a Polish wheat farmer who learns how quickly a hoarded blessing can become a curse; his orphan niece, a basketball star and witch\u2019s apprentice in furious flight from her grief; a voluble scarecrow and a New Deal photographer whose time-traveling camera threatens to reveal both the town\u2019s secrets and its fate. Russell's novel is above all a reckoning with a nation\u2019s forgetting --- enacting the settler amnesia and willful omissions passed down from generation to generation, and unearthing not only horrors but shimmering possibilities. THE ANTIDOTE echoes with urgent warnings for our own climate emergency, challenging readers with a vision of what might have been --- and what still could be.",

            "review": " For fans of TRUST and NORTH WOODS, a daring novel that spans 100 years of American history, from the early days of cinema to the rise of NFTs, about parents and children, the drive to create even in times of crisis and the inheritance of grand western dreams. It\u2019s 2024, and Tobey Harlan --- college dropout, temporary waiter, recently dumped --- steals from the wall of his father\u2019s house three paintings by the venerated and controversial artist Di Stiegl. Tobey\u2019s just lost everything he owns to a Northern California wildfire, and if he can sell the paintings (albeit in a shady way to a notorious tech bro) he can start life anew in a place no one will ever find him, perhaps even Oregon. A hundred years before, Klaus Aaronsohn --- German-Jewish immigrant, resident of the Lower East Side --- inveigles his way into a film studio in Astoria, Queens. In love with silent cinema, Klaus will restyle himself Klaus von Stiegl, a mysterious aristocratic German film director. In true Hollywood fashion, he will court fame, fortune, romance and betrayal, and end his career directing \"Brackett\": a radical, notorious 60s-era detective show. Weaving between Tobey and Klaus is the story of Diane \u201cDi\u201d Stiegl: Klaus\u2019s granddaughter, raised in Palm Springs, who claws out a career as an artist in gritty 1980s NYC. As America yields the presidency to a Hollywood cowboy, as Diane\u2019s grifter father and free-spirited mother circle in and out of her life, Diane will reflect America\u2019s most urgent and hypocritical years back to itself, uneasily finding critical adoration as well as great fame and wealth. A dazzling novel for readers of BEAUTIFUL RUINS by Jess Walter and THE CANDY HOUSE by Jennifer Egan, THE CALIFORNIANS is an ambitious and sweeping journey across a century.\u00a0 Nuanced and textured, gloriously funny, a critical portrait of the collective American consciousness that has brought us to today, it showcases Brian Castleberry as an inventive, stylish storyteller and a sharp observer of the human condition.",

            "review": " Lawrence Wright at the height of his powers. Centers around the newfound --- and forced --- relationship between a Palestinian American FBI agent and a hard-line Israeli cop, working together uneasily to solve the murder of the Israeli police chief in Gaza. Moving, thrilling, with extraordinary scope, it does for Palestine and Israel what Gorky Park did years ago for Russia. In the vein of John le Carr\u00e9 and Graham Greene, this is the rare novel that manages to entertain, educate and deeply move the reader. Tony Malik is a half-Irish, half-Arab New York-based FBI agent, specializing in money flowing from drug and arms deals. The novel opens in shocking fashion, and Malik\u2019s life changes radically. A long-term relationship ends, and his job is on the verge of being taken away from him. During this period he learns more about his roots and becomes interested in his father's past and family --- his father came to America years ago from Palestine. Malik decides to make a trip to his father's homeland to attend the wedding of his niece, whom he has never met. As a result of his plans, he is given a simple assignment by his boss at the FBI, partly to see how well he can still do his job. That simple assignment becomes anything but simple. As soon as he arrives in Gaza, the Israeli police chief overseeing the area is murdered. Malik is at first a suspect. Then, due to his superior investigative skills, he is invited into the Israeli investigation, seeking the murderer. At the core of this novel is Malik's relationship with Yossi, the hard-line anti-Arab Israeli police officer leading the investigation. They must learn to trust each other because, as they move closer to solving the case, they realize there is no one else they can trust on either side. Extraordinary three-dimensional characters populate this novel: Yossi's daughter, studying in Paris, trying to escape the violence that surrounds her in Israel; Malik's niece, whose wedding and life are shattered by the murder; her fianc\u00e9, a peacenik whose existence is complicated by the fact that his cousin is high up in the Hamas command; religious leaders on both sides; corrupt Israeli cops; Palestinians thirsting for violence against Israel; Israelis determined to crush the Palestinians. Lawrence Wright brings a wide and complicated tapestry to life, one that culminates on October 7, 2023, with the deadly Hamas attack on Israel. But he has written more than just a thriller, or even just an examination of all these complicated lives. He has written a novel that manages to explore and explain much of the devastating history that encompasses the relationship between Israel and Palestine --- and shows it to us in a way that poignantly reveals the tragic human scale that is involved.",

Virginia, 1864. Libby Steadman\u2019s husband has been away for so long that she can barely conjure his voice in her dreams. While she longs for him in the night, fearing him dead in a Union prison camp, her days are spent running a gristmill with her teenage niece, a hired hand and his wife, all the grain they can produce requisitioned by the Confederate Army. It\u2019s an uneasy life in the Shenandoah Valley, the territory frequently changing hands, control swinging back and forth like a pendulum between North and South, and Libby awakens every morning expecting to see her land a battlefield. And then she finds a gravely injured Union officer left for dead in a neighbor\u2019s house, the bones of his hand and leg shattered. Captain Jonathan Weybridge of the Vermont Brigade is her enemy --- but he\u2019s also a human being, and Libby must make a terrible decision: Does she leave him to die alone? Or does she risk treason and try to nurse him back to health? And if she succeeds, does she try to secretly bring him across Union lines, where she might negotiate a trade for news of her own husband? A vivid and sweeping story of two people navigating the boundaries of love and humanity in a landscape of brutal violence, THE JACKAL'S MISTRESS is a heart-stopping new novel, based on a largely unknown piece of American history, from one of our greatest storytellers.",

            "review": " An exhilarating thriller about a white nationalist group --- and the man taking them down from the inside --- written with critically acclaimed author Patrick Hoffman\u2019s \u201ccrisp pace and superb timing\u201d (Wall Street Journal). Bunny Simpson is at his usual post behind the counter at a Denver cigarette store when his volatile friend Jerry presents an opportunity: $500 to beat a guy up. Jerry has been dealing steroids to Helen, a lawyer, who is getting rapidly stronger just as she gets more erratic, vengeful towards her cheating ex-husband who she asks Jerry to attack. Bunny\u2019s relatively solid conscience isn\u2019t enough to stop him from biting --- Ray, his beloved quasi-uncle, is behind on rent for the apartment they share, and Bunny will do anything to bail him out. And it\u2019s a small favor; just friends helping friends. Right? Not quite. When Bunny and Jerry get arrested, Bunny finds himself faced with a choice: Go to jail for years, or take a plea deal to go undercover in a white nationalist group under federal investigation. Bunny obliges, and soon he finds himself witness to a new world of startling violence, toxic masculinity and warped conceptions of discipline, religion and patriotism. If these men discover that he\u2019s a snitch, they\u2019ll kill him without blinking. His life is at stake, but so is his freedom. Soon Bunny is embroiled in a criminal enterprise far darker than he could\u2019ve imagined --- a wasp\u2019s nest with eyes on him from all sides --- and he needs to penetrate it at its center. Patrick Hoffman, critically acclaimed author of EVERY MAN A MENACE and CLEAN HANDS, is at his brilliant best in these pages. A wholly unique portrait of friendship, extremism and the dual power of technology and money, FRIENDS HELPING FRIENDS is an electrifying thriller from a veritable talent.",

            "review": " From bestselling children's author Marianne Richmond comes a powerful memoir about overcoming a mother's emotional neglect and finding the courage to reclaim the story of your life. At nine years old, Marianne Richmond's life is upended when she collapses on her kitchen floor with full-body convulsions. \"Pinched nerve,\" says the ER doctor, a baffling explanation. But when one episode becomes many, it's clear something is wrong. Afraid to be at school, in her body and in her life, Marianne desperately hopes for help and healing. But her emotionally unavailable mother --- still reeling from her own past trauma --- refuses medication on Marianne's behalf, preferring to try prayer and homeopathy. At age 18, a full-body seizure in Marianne's dorm room leads her to a diagnosis, medication and --- at long last --- neurological intervention. Physically, Marianne feels \"fixed,\" but emotional healing proves more elusive. In the years to come, Marianne becomes a parent herself and writes a new story for her life. She authors children's books that touch millions of lives, each of them celebrating a mother's unconditional love for her children. A love her own heart still longs to know. When her mother becomes ill, Marianne has a choice to make: will she be present for the mother who rarely felt present to her? IF YOU WERE MY DAUGHTER is a story of learning to hear your own voice, of one daughter's return to wholeness and ultimately, a story of accepting that, despite all hope and longing, a mother's \"best I could\" can still fall far too short. Most of all, Marianne Richmond illuminates how the stories we're born into shape the ones we tell about ourselves --- and reminds us that we have the powerful permission to develop a new relationship with what is difficult in our lives, to fully choose and embody who we are meant to be.",

Jessica Fletcher has taken a nasty spill on the ice, leaving her in a wheelchair for several weeks. She tries to work on her latest manuscript but finds herself distracted by a new neighbor moving in across the street. There\u2019s good reason for her to be distracted, because soon after unpacking his sparse belongings, Mr. Rymer is out in the front yard, building somewhat risqu\u00e9 (read: naked) snow sculptures. While Cabot Cove debates whether the sculptures are a protected form of art or a public display of lewdness, someone starts destroying them at night. Rymer doesn\u2019t seem upset. He just makes new ones. No need to get the police involved over a little snow, he says. Especially when there\u2019s plenty more of it and a blizzard in the forecast. The morning after the storm, Jessica looks out the window to see a new sculpture across the street --- and the body of Mr. Rymer half-buried in the snow. Can Jessica catch a cold-blooded killer from her chair by the window?",

Cherry Hendricks might be down on her luck, but she can write the book on what makes something funny: she\u2019s a professional clown who creates raucous, zany fun at gigs all over Orlando. Between her clowning and her shifts at an aquarium store for extra cash, she\u2019s always hustling. Not to mention balancing her judgmental mother, her messy love life and her equally messy community of fellow performers. Things start looking up when Cherry meets Margot the Magnificent --- a much older lesbian magician --- who seems to have worked out the lines between art, business and life, and has a slick, successful career to prove it. With Margot\u2019s mentorship and industry connections, Cherry is sure to take her art to the next level. Plus, Margot is sexy as hell. It\u2019s not long before Cherry must decide how much she\u2019s willing to risk for Margot and for her own explosive new act --- and what kind of clown she wants to be under her suit. Equal parts bravado, tenderness and humor, and bursting with misfits, magicians, musicians and mimes, STOP ME IF YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE is a masterpiece of comedic fiction that asks big questions about art and performance, friendship and community, and the importance of timing in jokes and in life.",

Raised in a Greek legion, Phaidros has been taught to follow his commander's orders at all costs. But when Phaidros rescues a baby from a fire at Thebes's palace, his commander's orders cease to make sense: Phaidros is forced to abandon the blue-eyed boy at a temple, and to keep the baby's existence a total secret. Years later, struggling with panic attacks and flashbacks, Phaidros is enlisted by the Queen to find her son, Thebes' young crown prince, who has vanished to escape an arranged marriage. The search leads him to a blue-eyed witch named Dionysus, whose guidance is as wise as the events that surround him are strange. In Dionysus's company, Phaidros witnesses sudden outbursts of riots and unrest, and everywhere Dionysus goes, rumors follow about a new god, one sired by Zeus but lost in a fire. In THE HYMN TO DIONYSUS, bestselling author Natasha Pulley transports us to an ancient empire on the edge of ruin to tell an utterly captivating queer love story about a man needing a god to remind him how to be a human.",

In 1927, eight-year-old Clara Harrington\u2019s magical childhood shatters when her mother, renowned author Bronwyn Newcastle Fordham, disappears off the coast of South Carolina. Bronwyn stunned the world with a book written in an invented language that became a national sensation when she was just 12 years old. Her departure leaves behind not only a devoted husband and heartbroken daughter, but also the hope of ever translating the sequel to her landmark work. As the headlines focus on the missing author, Clara yearns for something far deeper and more insatiable: her beautiful mother. By 1952, Clara is an illustrator raising her own daughter, Wynnie. When a stranger named Charlie Jameson contacts her from London claiming to have discovered a handwritten dictionary of her mother\u2019s lost language, Clara is skeptical. Compelled by the tragedy of her mother\u2019s vanishing, she crosses the Atlantic with Wynnie only to arrive during one of London\u2019s most deadly natural disasters --- the Great Smog. With asthmatic Wynnie in peril, they escape the city with Charlie and find refuge in the Jameson\u2019s family retreat nestled in the Lake District. It is there that Clara must find the courage to uncover the truth about her mother and the story she left behind. Told in Patti Callahan Henry\u2019s lyrical, enchanting prose, THE STORY SHE LEFT BEHIND is a captivating novel of mystery and family legacy that captures the profound longing for a mother and the evergreen allure of secrets.",

From the New York Times bestselling author of THE CLOISTERS comes an electrifying thriller about an opulent family retreat to Italy that\u2019s shattered by the resurfacing of a decades-old crime. In 1992, Sarah Lingate is found dead below the cliffs of Capri, leaving behind her three-year-old daughter, Helen. Despite suspicions that the old-money Lingates are involved, Sarah\u2019s death is ruled an accident. And every year, the family returns to prove it\u2019s true. But on the 30th anniversary of Sarah\u2019s death, the Lingates arrive at the villa to find a surprise waiting for them --- the necklace Sarah was wearing the night she died. Haunted by the specter of that night, the legendary Lingate family unity is pushed to a breaking point, and Helen seizes the opportunity. Enlisting the help of Lorna Moreno, a family assistant, the two plot their escape from Helen\u2019s paranoid, insular family. But when Lorna disappears and the investigation into Sarah\u2019s death is reopened, Helen has to confront the fact that everyone who was on Capri 30 years ago remains a suspect --- her controlling father, Richard; her rarely lucid aunt, Naomi; her distant uncle, Marcus and their circle of friends, visitors and staff. Even Lorna, her closest ally, may not be who she seems. As long-hidden secrets about that night boil to surface, one thing becomes clear: Not everyone will leave the island alive.",

Naema, an elderly princess dedicated to her pet causes, is in a bind: struck by a malady that maroons her in Montreux, she\u2019s unable to host an exclusive gala dinner in Berlin to honor the author Masud al-Huzeil for his lifetime achievement in Arabic literature. Not only is she unable to attend, RSVPs have been slow to materialize, and she\u2019s reduced to begging the ancient award winner to find some attendees at the last minute. Masud invites his old friend Demian, a native Berliner, who in turn invites his two best friends: the troubled, innocent Livia and an American publisher, Toto, who will do anything for a free meal. But Toto doesn\u2019t come alone. In tow are his younger Internet date --- she\u2019s stood him up often enough to be nicknamed \u201cthe Flake\u201d --- and Demian\u2019s 15-year-old daughter, Nicole. Not to mention the cop who\u2019s been trailing Nicole since she left the red-light district. Presiding over the affair is Naema\u2019s infinitely rich, endlessly disaffected grandson, Prince Radi, whose pass at Nicole culminates in an epic midnight food run that changes all their lives. With sophistication and tenderness, Nell Zink weaves a vividly colored tapestry of a milieu at odds with itself, taking her trademark ambiguity, daring and humor to new heights.",

Cosby,\u201d and in this breakneck new novel, sheriff Mick Hardin navigates the treacherous terrain of a town\u2019s festering secrets and the violent forces who want to keep them hidden. Lauded as a \u201cmasterclass in the craft of crime fiction\u201d (CrimeReads), Chris Offutt\u2019s beloved and critically acclaimed Mick Hardin series is an atmospheric, tightly crafted testament to Southern noir. THE RELUCTANT SHERIFF is a dark, bracing return to the hills of eastern Kentucky where secrets roil beneath the surface, and nothing and no one stays in the past for long. Mick Hardin never wanted to be sheriff. An ex-Army CID officer, he\u2019s supposed to be retired --- or he was until his sister, Linda, was shot in the line of duty, requiring him to step in as interim sheriff while she recovered. Now he\u2019s stuck in Rocksalt, the place he was most hoping to escape. Back in uniform, Mick is chafing at the sudden dissolution of his retirement plans, wearied by the petty squabbles of Rocksalt\u2019s townsfolk. It\u2019s all business as usual, until the murder of a local bar owner draws an unlikely suspect who threatens to fan the flames of Mick\u2019s past. When two more bodies turn up, seemingly unconnected to the first, Mick is forced to reckon with the mysterious circumstances of a case not so open-and-shut as everyone believes. Meanwhile, Linda is slowly healing when a familiar business tycoon with a vested interest in her returning as sheriff makes it difficult for her to remain on the sidelines. Unflinching and devilishly compulsive, THE RELUCTANT SHERIFF is an explosive thriller confirming Chris Offutt as a Southern writer of muscular prose and unrivaled talent.",

The sum of human existence --- words, images, transactions, memes, voices, viruses --- travels through the tiny fiber-optic tubes. But sometimes the tubes break, at an unfathomable depth. Fennell\u2019s journey brings him to the west coast of Africa, where he uncovers a story about the raw human labor behind the dazzling veneer of the technological world. He meets a fellow Irishman, John Conway, the chief of mission on a cable repair ship. The mysterious Conway is a skilled engineer and a freediver capable of reaching extraordinary depths. He is also in love with a South African actress, Zanele, who must leave to go on her own literary adventure to London. When the ship is sent up the coast to repair a series of major underwater breaks, both men learn that the very cables they seek to fix carry the news that may cause their lives to unravel. At sea, they are forced to confront the most elemental questions of life, love, absence, belonging and the perils of our severed connections. Can we, in our fractured world, reweave ourselves out of the thin, broken threads of our pasts? Can the ruptured things awaken us from our despair? Resoundingly simple and turbulent at the same time, TWIST is a meditation on the nature of narrative and truth from one of the great storytellers of our times.",

            "review": " From the pages of Vanity Fair to the red carpets of Hollywood, editor Graydon Carter\u2019s memoir revives the glamorous heyday of print magazines when they were at the vanguard of American culture. When Graydon Carter was offered the editorship of Vanity Fair in 1992, he knew he faced an uphill battle --- how to make the esteemed and long-established magazine his own. Not only was he confronted with a staff that he perceived to be loyal to the previous regime, he arrived only a few years after launching Spy magazine, which gloried in skewering the celebrated and powerful --- the very people Vanity Fair venerated. With curiosity, fearlessness, and a love of recent history and glamour that would come to define his storied career in magazines, Carter succeeded in endearing himself to his editors, contributors and readers, as well as many of the faces that would come to appear in Vanity Fair\u2019s pages. He went on to run the magazine with overwhelming success for the next two-and-a-half decades. Filled with colorful memories and intimate details, WHEN THE GOING WAS GOOD is Graydon Carter\u2019s lively recounting of how he made his mark as one of the most talented editors in the business. Moving to New York from Canada, he worked at Time, Life, The New York Observer and Spy before catching the eye of Cond\u00e9 Nast chairman Si Newhouse, who pulled him in to run Vanity Fair. In Newhouse he found an unwavering champion, a loyal proprietor who gave Carter the editorial and financial freedom to thrive. Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photographs would come to define the look of the magazine, as would the \u201cNew Establishment\u201d and annual Hollywood issues. Carter further planted a flag in Los Angeles with the legendary Vanity Fair Oscar party. With his inimitable voice and signature quip, he brings readers to lunches and dinners with the great and good of America, Britain and Europe. He assembled one of the most formidable stables of writers and photographers under one roof, and here he recreates in real time the steps he took to ensure Vanity Fair cemented its place as the epicenter of art, culture, business and politics, even as digital media took hold. Charming, candid and brimming with stories, WHEN THE GOING WAS GOOD perfectly captures the last golden age of print magazines from the inside out.",

            "review": " Like jazz itself, 3 SHADES OF BLUE has several layers. Part biography, part music history, (large) part substance abuse, with a little music theory thrown in, it spends the most time on trumpeter Miles Davis, with smaller components of sax man John Coltrane and Bill Evans, a white piano genius who found a place in the mostly African-American genre during the era in which the book is set. Davis, Coltrane and Evans were not just fiendish performers; they were next-level creators. Through many years of gigs both small and large and numerous acquaintances in common, the three finally come together to create what many consider one of the best jazz albums of all time, Kind of Blue. \"Kaplan has impressed us enough to believe that he knows what he\u2019s talking about. And though he may lament 'the lost empire of cool,' fans of that particular space of jazz will always manage a way to find it again.\" In some ways, 3 SHADES OF BLUE can be looked at as a sort of cookbook, with the trio (as well as contemporaries Thelonious Monk and Dizzy Gillespie, among others) creating the most delicious of musical dishes. We meet scores of \u201cchefs,\u201d almost all of whom seem to be at the top of their class, and many of whom have serious addiction issues. It\u2019s a wonder that some of the greats --- including the three musicians of the title, as well as Charlie Parker --- were able to remain upright long enough to scratch out a tune. Some were incapacitated enough to miss gigs at the very least and wind up in jail at the worst. One chapter lists more than 20 musicians and singers --- Evans among them --- who died way before their time. Davis was able to get a grip on his substance abuse issues, for the most part. Author James Kaplan depicts him as a complicated man, at once incredibly insecure and narcissistic, especially early in his career when he was looking for acceptance among his musical elders. In the charming movie That Thing You Do, the main character asks a hotel employee where he could find good jazz. \u201cOh, you want good jazz? Good jazz?\u201d asks the hotelier. \u201cLet me ask you a question: Who played coronet for Jacques St. Claire on Vital Stats?\u201d The correct answer gets our star access to the area\u2019s top club. That\u2019s what 3 SHADES OF BLUE reminded me of. Kaplan (no relation to this writer) has obviously done a masterful job of research, but overall the book lacks a certain something. He expects his readers to already possess a fairly thorough knowledge, as he drops names, dates and venues on page after page, often without much in the way of explanation. That might exclude some people who, to paraphrase the saying, don\u2019t know jazz, but they know what they like. Kaplan, who has written biographies of Frank Sinatra and Irving Berlin, admits that he himself is no expert in the field. Prior to his first meeting with Davis for a Vanity Fair profile in 1989, he realized how little he actually knew about his subject and the art form and was petrified of completing the assignment. Almost 40 years later, Kaplan has impressed us enough to believe that he knows what he\u2019s talking about. And though he may lament \u201cthe lost empire of cool,\u201d fans of that particular space of jazz will always manage a way to find it again.

            "review": " New York Times bestselling author Xochitl Gonzalez, whose prize-winning debut, OLGA DIES DREAMING, was named a \u201cBest Book of the Year\u201d many times over, makes a triumphant, scintillating return with ANITA DE MONTE LAUGHS LAST. This urgent call to action and reckoning not only affirms the power of art, but confronts its startling lack of diversity, both in galleries and museums and in academia. In the 1980s, artist Anita de Monte was a Cuban-born refugee who made her own name in New York before marrying a famous sculptor, Jack Martin. The coupling of artists can be rocky at best. Jack is a proud pot-stirrer whose controversial opinions are as well-known as his lauded artwork. With his constantly putting Anita down or demeaning her identity as a Latina woman, it\u2019s easy to see why their passion plays out not just in the bedroom, but in verbal spars and barbs as well. Even more surprising is the night that Anita falls or is pushed out of a window, plummeting to her death. Jack, meanwhile, is accused and then acquitted of her murder. He\u2019s free to continue boasting and bragging about his own derivative work in perpetuity, even as the cause of his wife\u2019s death is left unsolved. Thirteen years later, not much has changed for Latina women in the arts. White men still snag the best galleries and lavish museum openings, and they still populate most of the art textbooks and curriculums, even at prestigious liberal arts colleges like Brown University. It is here where we meet Raquel Toro, a Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican art history student working on her thesis. Under the watchful, occasionally demeaning eye of her (you guessed it, white and male) professor, John Temple, Raquel has chosen to study the works of Jack Martin --- not necessarily because she feels drawn to him, but because she knows he is a \u201csafe\u201d subject who will impress Temple. \"ANITA DE MONTE LAUGHS LAST is a gorgeous, ponderous and bitingly sharp takedown of the art world and its hypocrisies.... Peppered with infuriating microaggressions, acts of white saviorism and pure white supremacy, this book is a scathing takedown of white exceptionalism.\" As one of the few students of color on Brown\u2019s campus, Raquel is too familiar with the need for balance: of being just Latina enough to make her peers feel worldly, but not so Latina that they feel uncomfortable in their whiteness; of championing other women and Black and Latine artists, but not so much that she is seen as a rebel or a disturbance. Her primary goal is to graduate and pursue a career in museums, and if compromise is what it takes, she can acquiesce. In addition to the backing of her faculty supervisor, Temple, Raquel has landed a highly esteemed internship under Belinda Kim, an acclaimed Asian American feminist curator who is the polar opposite of Raquel\u2019s advisor. While Temple calls himself a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d who believes that identity politics and affirmative action dictate too much of art\u2019s focus, Kim is against \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d and encourages Raquel to dig deeper, prompting her discovery of the story of Jack\u2019s wife and her mysterious death. It\u2019s worth mentioning now that both Jack and Anita are based on the true story of the death of artist Ana Mendieta. While Anita\u2019s rise to fame and fall to death mirror Ana\u2019s almost point for point, Gonzalez takes a strong stance here about the circumstances of her death. She gives Ana a voice through Anita, allowing the specter of her passing --- and all of that lost potential --- to intertwine with Raquel\u2019s study of the underappreciated artist\u2019s life. But just as Raquel is beginning her thesis, she becomes entangled with Nick Fitzsimmons. Nick is a wunderkind senior who already has exhibited and sold his art to famous museums and collectors. His warmth and ability to poke fun at his own privilege quickly endear him to Raquel. In a world of peers who accuse her of being an \u201caffirmative action admit,\u201d Nick\u2019s willingness to confront his own whiteness and consider her both as an artist and as a Latina artist (none of that \u201cI don\u2019t see race\u201d nonsense here!) is refreshing and intoxicating. However, as Gonzalez demonstrates in chapters written in Anita\u2019s perspective, powerful white men are always happy to champion those they perceive as \u201cless than,\u201d \u201cother\u201d or \u201cexotic\u201d --- at least until the divide between them shrinks and the competition heats up. Raquel is aware that her connection to Nick can open new doors and worlds for her and her art, but it is not until their relationship starts to closely, dangerously mimic that of Anita and Jack that it becomes apparent just how little has changed, in both society at large and the art world in particular. With the voice of Anita adding a dash of magical realism to the narrative, and the romantic relationships and career trajectories of both Raquel and Anita creeping dangerously close to the same conclusion, Raquel realizes just how much of her history, her culture and her potential have been relegated from the mainstream and cast into obscurity. And like Gonzalez\u2019s Olga of OLGA DIES DREAMING, Raquel is not quite ready to be sidelined. ANITA DE MONTE LAUGHS LAST is a gorgeous, ponderous and bitingly sharp takedown of the art world and its hypocrisies. For an industry full of diversity and beauty, Gonzalez reminds her readers just how white it and other industries like it remain, and how easily mold-breakers like Anita (Ana) and Raquel have been pushed aside. Peppered with infuriating microaggressions, acts of white saviorism and pure white supremacy, this book is a scathing takedown of white exceptionalism. Gonzalez is unflinching and uncompromising in her portrayals of men like Jack, John and Nick, who claim to be the \u201cgood ones\u201d but are often crueler in their takedowns of successful Latina women than even the most racist of their peers. But in her prose, which is crystalline and sharp, expertly restrained and wildly inventive, she transmutes the rage that these men and their bigoted acts inspire, turning it into something far more powerful: joy. The joy of finding and championing oneself and, of course, the joy that comes with knowing that you are ready to bust down any door, break any glass ceiling and claim the ferocious, vital energy of creation for yourself. There are a lot of heartaches and difficult confrontations here, but the sheer dynamism and energy of fighting with, alongside and for the women Gonzalez introduces make those painful realizations educational, inspiring and, above all, galvanizing.

            "review": " The most important event in Kara Swisher\u2019s life occurred when she was five. Her father had a new job, running a department at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. He had just bought his first house. But before he could move his family in, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died. \u201cWhen you\u2019re five, your parents are pretty much your entire world,\u201d his daughter would write in BURN BOOK: A Tech Love Story. \u201cIt gives you a sense of the capriciousness of life: that life can change on a dime, that bad things happen, and that you survive them, you just keep going.\u201d Her father\u2019s death became her superpower. It has enabled her to leap Everest-high Silicon Valley egos, survive Rupert Murdoch, launch a mega-successful conference and podcast, and become the most visible --- and feared --- writer on tech. \"My advice to Kara Swisher: Don\u2019t mellow. Run full speed through the tape. Remember: the finish line is not the finish. Don\u2019t stop. And especially\u2026keep writing.\" In 1987, I knew Kara through her assistant, Lisa Dickey, who pestered me to share AOL stories. Good idea. For 30 years, I was a journalist. Suddenly I was the Editorial Director of AOL. Maybe I hadn\u2019t gone corporate. Lisa called often with questions I wouldn\u2019t answer. No one calls after 11pm on a Sunday night except to report a death or an emergency.\u00a0Why was Kara Swisher calling? Because she was rolling through her list of AOL executives, and she knew I was a friend of AOL CEO Bob Pittman. Kara was on a mission, so our conversation was brief: \u201cJesse, do you know anything about an AOL\u2013Time Warner merger?\u201d \u201cNo. But I do now.\u201d Kara laughed. \u201cIf you hear anything tonight, write Lisa.\u201d And she was gone. Her piece was excellent and deeply sourced; I became a regular reader. All these years later, she\u2019s published her third book, a memoir that\u2019s an unofficial history of the human side of the internet --- the quirky personalities, the outsized egos and worse.\u00a0\u201cI have basically made a career out of stepping out of line,\u201d she writes. If anything, she understates. \u201cWhen people get really rich, they seem to attract legions of enablers who lick them up and down all day. Many of these billionaires start to think of this fawning as reality, where suddenly everything that comes out of their mouths is golden\u2026. But if you knew them in the before times and have some prior knowledge of their original selves, you either become an asset (truth-teller) or a threat (truth-teller) to them.\u201d Or, shorter: \u201cWhen the truth stands between a man and his next $100 million, the truth is always going to be escorted off the premises.\u201d This hasn\u2019t stopped her. It hasn\u2019t even slowed her down. Increasingly, she\u2019s an unrequested analyst and advocate, moderating a non-televised episode of \u201cThe Apprentice: Nerd Edition.\u201d She ranks the nerds: Mark Zuckerberg: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t an a**hole. He was worse. He was one of the most carelessly dangerous men in the history of tech who didn\u2019t even know it.\u201d Elon Musk: \u201cThe more damage he unleashed, the less he cared\u2026. A pr*ck, started at 1, hit 12, then to infinity and beyond.\u201d Bill Gates: \u201cI told him, \u2018I like you 10% more because you\u2019re married to Melinda.\u201d [They\u2019re now divorced.] Steve Jobs: \u201c8 for being a pr*ck, 10 for accomplishment.\u201d Jeff Bezos: \u201cHe came closest to Jobs. He reinvented commerce, saw the importance of the cloud and innovated logistics.\u201d Amazon: \u201cGoing to work there would have been a prescription for disaster. That said, $100 million would have been nice.\u201d Her opening line to Mark Cuban: \u201cI heard you think I\u2019m an a**hole.\u201d [They became friends.] A movie, William Goldman wrote, is five big moments connected by other moments. Here are some of the biggies: Zuckerberg onstage at a conference, sweating through his hoodie until Swisher made him take it off.\u00a0And a chapter about the first joint interview with Gates and Jobs in 25 years. Later, Jobs told her, \u201cThe people who love you are the only ones who count. Don\u2019t waste your time on anyone else.\u201d And then, she writes, \u201cWonder of wonders, he gave me a hug.\u201d On a 13-hour flight to Hong Kong, she suffered a stroke and a heart attack. She married a woman who told her she wanted to be pregnant. Swisher cheered --- between them, they have four children.\u00a0She continues to be \u201can optimistic pessimist.\u201d She is, she says, \u201caware that telling smart people to think smarter comes across as rude at times.\u201d My take on Kara Swisher: Rachel Maddow\u2026with a lot less\u00a0shtick. My advice to Kara Swisher: Don\u2019t mellow. Run full speed through the tape. Remember: the finish line is not the finish. Don\u2019t stop. And especially\u2026keep writing.

John, an impoverished Scottish minister, has accepted a job evicting the lone remaining occupant of an island north of Scotland --- Ivar, who has been living alone for decades, with only the animals and the sea for company. Though his wife, Mary, has serious misgivings about the errand, he decides to go anyway, setting in motion a chain of events that neither he nor Mary could have predicted.

            "review": " There are several mysteries in Sally Hepworth's new novel, DARLING GIRLS. The first, and the vehicle she uses to bring the main characters back to their childhood foster home of nightmares, is the bones found buried under the large farmhouse where they lived. Holly Fairchild --- Miss Fairchild to Jessica, Norah and Alicia --- took in foster children. It was decades later, when she sold the house and it was demolished, that the bones were discovered. Jessica, Norah and Alicia return to the site of the house together. While there are no blood ties between the girls, all of whom are women now, they are as close as --- or even closer than --- real sisters because of the shared trauma they endured. Miss Fairchild seemed to be a lovely lady who was pretty, charming and openly affectionate on the rare occasions that others were present. But once they were alone, the \"pretty\" mask came off, and what was underneath was the stuff of nightmares. \"[E]ven as we think we understand what has happened and why, Hepworth is not done with the surprises as she deftly flips the rug over to show us that what we thought we were seeing is not the truth at all...\" Jessica suffered the most from the abuse and cruelty because at first Miss Fairchild was loving and kind. She insisted Jessica call her Mummy. She spoiled Jessica, who slept with her and didn't leave her side at all. But when Jessica started school and made friends, Miss Fairchild changed. She turned into a monster, not allowing Jessica to do anything outside of school, withholding food and demanding that Jessica clean the already immaculate house. She controlled every moment of Jessica's time. When first one girl and then another arrived, Miss Fairchild was treated to additional children to torture. Her methods were diabolically clever, and the details sound rather benign. But the manner in which Hepworth describes them are chilling. The only bright spot was that they had each other. When they finally joined forces to free themselves from Miss Fairchild, their lives already had been changed by the cruelty that was inflicted on them by their monstrous foster mother. Now, while they are outwardly successful, each woman has a personality flaw that inhibits her from seeking happiness and contentment. While they work and support themselves, they are living half-lives. Jessica is married, but her relationship with her foster sisters takes precedence over her marriage to a very nice man, which suffers. Norah still has huge anger management problems and has been arrested multiple times for assault. Alicia is unable to think that she is worthy of love, so she lives alone. As we expect from Hepworth, DARLING GIRLS is perfectly plotted. We find out more about these women in chapters told from each of their points of view, in both the past and the present. But there are also mysterious conversations that someone --- we don't know who --- is having with a therapist. Through these cryptic exchanges, we learn more about the motives and background of Miss Fairchild and Wild Meadows Farm, where the story is mostly set. But even as we think we understand what has happened and why, Hepworth is not done with the surprises as she deftly flips the rug over to show us that what we thought we were seeing is not the truth at all, but rather a cleverly constructed tale to entertain. The ending is brilliant thanks to the superb plotting and pacing of the whole of the book that precedes it. Reviewed by Pamela Kramer on April 26, 2024",

            "review": " Imran Mahmood is a practicing criminal barrister in England and Wales. He utilizes all of this experience in his second novel, FINDING SOPHIE, which features some stunningly realistic courtroom scenes as part of a much larger story about a grieving family. Harry and Zara King are mourning the sudden and inexplicable disappearance of their 17-year-old daughter, Sophie. The book opens inside Courtroom Three at London\u2019s famous Old Bailey courthouse, one year after Sophie vanished. The subject is a murder trial, but we are not made aware of the victim\u2019s identity or who the accused party may be. Subsequent chapters will slowly piece these answers together, and they are quite eye-opening, even shocking. \"FINDING SOPHIE is an addictive read that Imran Mahmood tells with so much heart. It will reach deep into the soul of any parent who decides to pick it up.\" It has become a common practice in modern thriller writing to have chapters told from the points of view of different characters. In this case, it makes a lot of sense, and the chapters told from the sometimes differing points of view of Harry and Zara make for a nice puzzle of a novel. Sophie seems to be a well-adjusted young lady with mostly normal, if not slightly overprotective, parents. After all, she is their only child. Following an uncommon difference of opinion, Sophie indicates that she is going for a walk. That is the last time they ever see their daughter. As the novel progresses, chapter by chapter and revelation by revelation, readers begin to get the many different pieces of the puzzle to try to understand what may have happened to Sophie. Up front, none of her mates seem to know anything. That is until her BFF, Emily, begins to come clean about Sophie having a secret boyfriend --- described only as older and working at a pub --- and eventually confesses to receiving a text from her a day after she was reported missing. Of course, Emily erased that message as she wasn\u2019t aware what was going on with her friend. A business card found in Sophie\u2019s room leads Harry to Katya, a spiritualist and tarot card reader who regularly met with Sophie. Even though he does not believe in magic of any kind, Harry agrees to let Katya read him. What she produces during their first meeting ends up being quite telling. Katya sees an image of a wall with Sophie, indicating that she was blocking a secret from everyone or had some sort of secret hidden inside a wall. This revelation causes Sophie\u2019s anguished, desperate parents to rip apart her room in search of any clues. What they turn up is completely unexpected. It is at this point that they make some decisions that will color their future, as well as their daughter\u2019s. Teenage characters are difficult to write, especially in mysteries and thrillers, as they behave so unpredictably and are prone to making bad decisions. That\u2019s not to say that adults aren\u2019t equally capable of this sort of behavior, which becomes quite clear when discussing Harry and Zara. In the chapters told from Harry\u2019s point of view, Sophie\u2019s name is only depicted with an \u201cS,\u201d almost like it has been redacted. We learn only later that this is symbolic of the fact that Harry is unable to say his daughter\u2019s name aloud ever since she has gone missing. Even though they have a solid marriage, Harry and Zara are human beings who handle grief differently and, as such, become physically separated during the course of the story. FINDING SOPHIE is an addictive read that Imran Mahmood tells with so much heart. It will reach deep into the soul of any parent who decides to pick it up. Reviewed by Ray Palen on March 9, 2024",

            "review": " Canadian writer Anne Michaels is both a poet and a novelist, and her poetic sensibility suffuses HELD, her third novel. With its blend of fictional and real characters, its elliptical style, and a narrative structure that hopscotches across the 20th and early 21st centuries in non-chronological fashion, it\u2019s a work that\u2019s reminiscent of intellectually challenging ones like Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s FLIGHTS and Maria Popova\u2019s FIGURING. But above all, its defining characteristic is Michaels\u2019 facility with language that she uses to paint evocative and moving scenes. In an email interview with the CBC last year, Michaels described her aspiration for the novel: \u201cI wanted to explore the effects over time, of our inner lives --- what is essentially invisible; how moments of comprehension, desire, transcendence, doubt, belief, the longing for meaning ---\u00a0work their transformations decades later.\u201d \"HELD is a work that\u2019s best consumed in small bites rather than greedily devoured. It\u2019s also one that can be revisited with pleasure, spurred by the search for connections that may have been missed on a first reading.\" Michaels pursues that goal through glimpses of an assortment of characters that include a wounded English veteran of World War I and his artist wife, their granddaughter --- a physician who travels to war zones in the 1980s to work in \u201crefugee camps, field hospitals, the most dangerous places\u201d --- and her journalist lover, and the scientist Marie Curie and her British scientific colleague, Hertha Ayrton. The connections among these characters are suggested rather than made explicit, inviting readers to participate in the creative process by teasing them out of the narrative. One recurring motif marries the art of photography to the subject of loss and memory. It appears early in the novel when John, with his \u201clame leg\u201d and still suffering the physical and psychological effects of his involvement in the First World War\u2019s savage trench warfare, is reunited with his wife, Helena, at their home in Yorkshire. The couple live above John\u2019s photography studio, where he specializes in portraits of his fellow injured soldiers. After he develops one of those pictures, he\u2019s shocked to see a ghostly image on the print that turns out to be that of the deceased mother of his soldier subject. Michaels\u2019 description of this remarkable event is illustrative of both her theme and her lyrical style: \u201cThere are so many ways the dead show us they are with us. Sometimes they stay deliberately absent, in order to prove themselves by returning. Sometimes they stay close and then leave in order to prove they were with us. Sometimes they bring a stag to a graveyard, a cardinal to a fence, a song on the wireless as soon as you turn it on. Sometimes they bring a snowfall.\u201d And then, in a scene that takes place in France in 1910, a widow named Lia encounters a mysterious photographer in a wintry field. In their brief meeting, he observes, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a camera to see or to remember\u2026but you need a camera for proof of what is no longer so that others can remember.\u201d But when Lia reflects on the loss of her late husband, she concludes that \u201c[t]o erase someone from an image does not erase the memory of their having been in that place, does not erase the memory of that person, or that person\u2019s memory.\u201d In the novel\u2019s brief concluding chapter, set in the Gulf of Finland in 2025, Michaels returns to the theme of recollection, referring to \u201c[t]he long fuse of memory, always alight,\u201d and asks, \u201cWho can say what happens when we are remembered?\u201d Marrying substance and style, one of Michaels\u2019 favorite techniques involves the use of short sections featuring no more than a sentence or two of text. This one, placed between two others describing the death of one of John\u2019s young comrades in the trench near him, is representative of her poetically influenced prose: \u201cThe shadow of the bird\u2019s folding and unfolding, like a silk scarf in the wind, wings against the sky like the turning of a page inside out, a message passing between them.\u201d Enigmatic, provocative images like these, and some of the questions Michaels poses that linger in the mind like Zen k\u014dans, combine to induce an almost meditative state while reading this book. For that reason, HELD is a work that\u2019s best consumed in small bites rather than greedily devoured. It\u2019s also one that can be revisited with pleasure, spurred by the search for connections that may have been missed on a first reading. Serious readers will come away from the novel challenged and refreshed by their encounter with the work of a mature, confident writer. Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg on February 2, 2024",

            "review": " Native American author Nick Medina follows up his successful debut, SISTERS OF THE LOST NATION, with INDIAN BURIAL GROUND, another story that delves into cultural horror and its effects on modern-day reservation inhabitants. Noemi Broussard is a grown woman who still lives with her mother and is seeking to find happiness. She believes she has found just that with her boyfriend, Roddy. That is, until the arrival of her Uncle Louie, who brings with him the unfortunate news that Roddy was struck and killed by a car on the road. In her interview with the police, the driver indicates that he seemingly leapt out of nowhere directly in front of her vehicle. \"INDIAN BURIAL GROUND is not your typical horror story, yet it still rings true to what scares all of us. I am so glad that there are authors like Nick Medina who are using their fertile imagination to tell these tales.\" When Louie arrives at the scene, he finds what is left of Roddy. Most of his remains was already enjoyed by a coyote who the driver thought she saw in a hallucinatory moment post-accident, the animal\u2019s muzzle covered in blood. Noemi is devastated and tries to take solace in cryptic text messages she sends back and forth with Roddy\u2019s sister. Meanwhile, Louie is distant for other reasons. He knows he has seen this before, and memories of horrors from his past on the same reservation come flooding back to raise his fear level all over again. Medina does an admirable job of jumping back and forth between the present-day happenings and the retelling of previous horrors through chapters presented from the points of view of both Noemi and Louie. The stories from the past are truly frightening and otherworldly. Louie\u2019s memory is still crystal clear as he recalls incidents that were attributed to the legendary Takoda Vampire. In the summer of 1986, a member of the reservation had to be this very vampire because unexplainable, supernatural events were taking place. Everything from shapeshifting creatures to missing residents and the most frightening thing of all --- apparently deceased individuals sitting up in their coffins and speaking. Such occurrences hit home with Louie, and his Grandpa Joe is very much involved in these strange activities. The much younger Louie wants to protect his family, especially his little niece Noemi, who he fears may be targeted by the evil that is consuming the reservation. In the present, Louie thinks that there may be similarities between Roddy\u2019s unexpected death and the same ancient evil that tormented him back in 1986. The difference this time is that he is much older and not able to fight whatever this supernatural enemy may be all by himself. So Noemi joins the fray and, together with her uncle, will seek to find the answers to whatever plague might be starting again and finally put an end to it before nothing is left of their small community. INDIAN BURIAL GROUND is not your typical horror story, yet it still rings true to what scares all of us. I am so glad that there are authors like Nick Medina who are using their fertile imagination to tell these tales. Along with classic Native American horror writers like Owl Goingback and, more recently, Stephen Graham Jones, there is so much more to explore in this mystical culture, and I look forward to it.

            "review": " In a little village in the midst of Britain\u2019s Cotswolds sits Easley House, a grand English manor whose glory days appear to be behind it. Lord Teddy Roughton, Easley House\u2019s most recent heir, married Mona Ramsey, a colorful American woman, so that he could run off to live his dream in San Francisco. Lord Teddy left his wife behind to run the manor. Being Her Ladyship suits her when it suits her, which is to say when paying guests arrive. It turned out that Easley House had some rather costly issues --- like a leaky roof --- and simply keeping it heated nearly requires a mortgage, thus the need for extra help. So they present Easley House as a sort of B&B. Aiding in the endeavor is Mona\u2019s adopted son, Wilfred, who is more than willing to help. There is also old Mr. Hargis, the gardener who, in reality, has seen better days himself. Mona\u2019s girlfriend, Poppy, from the village occasionally drops by with some odd surprise and fashions special calligraphic place markers or other classy adornments to impress guests. This works its magic on American couple Ernie and Rhonda Blaylock, who are booked for a romantic weekend at Easley. \"In this 10th and last Tales of the City novel, MONA OF THE MANOR brings together Armistead Maupin\u2019s most beloved characters in this tale of tales for a very satisfying finale.\" Aside from the impressive place markers --- which are entirely unnecessary since Ernie and Rhonda are the only guests at the manor --- the weekend doesn\u2019t get off to an impressive start. They arrive in a driving rainstorm. That\u2019s to be expected; it\u2019s England. But Ernie immediately settles into a sour mood. First, guests can\u2019t use the front door. In fact, no one can; it's nailed shut. Once inside, they are confronted with buckets set strategically around the rooms to catch the myriad leaks. By now, Ernie nearly blows a fuse. He can\u2019t believe they paid a thousand pounds for this! Rhonda is charmed by it all, even though Mona drops the Lady Roughton act almost immediately. Mona can be anything but refined, and usually she is. The evening struggles along. The best part might have been Wilfred\u2019s delectable food. But Rhonda doesn\u2019t exactly get to enjoy dinner as Ernie\u2019s demeanor takes a very dark turn. By morning, though, Ernie seems much more chipper. After breakfast, he suggests to Rhonda that they take a walk in the bluebell woods. Along the way, Mr. Hargis meets them, inquiring about the state of the bluebells and warns them about a Gypsy who sometimes roams the woods. Rhonda doesn\u2019t quite get what that\u2019s all about. Mona hadn\u2019t mentioned any sort of danger out there. Back at Easley House again, Ernie clouds over once more while Rhonda goes up to soak in a tub and reflect on their trip so far. Enjoying her bath but not her thoughts, she dials the house phone to ask Mona to come to her room. Thereafter, situations change. The days that follow are busy ones leading up to the Midsummer festival, a made-up affair concocted by Mona herself. Their dear friend, Michael Tolliver, is coming for a much-anticipated visit, and it will be at just the perfect time. Wilfred has been at loose ends lately. Now and then, he takes a run into London to try hooking up with someone, but the pickings have been slim. From what he\u2019s learned, Michael broke it off with his most recent paramour, so\u2026maybe? Just the possibility makes him eagerly watch the calendar. Easley House hosts a few visitors after Ernie and Rhonda, but the focus is mostly on Midsummer. The festival is the culmination of many things. Not only is Wilfred hoping for new love, Michael is bringing a surprise along with him. And Mona has a surprise of her own. At least one. In this 10th and last Tales of the City novel, MONA OF THE MANOR brings together Armistead Maupin\u2019s most beloved characters in this tale of tales for a very satisfying finale.

            "review": " Lottie Hazell's debut novel starts with what could be a rather predictable scene in a traditional comedy of manners. Engaged couple Kit and Piglet (a nickname she's had since childhood) are preparing to host their first-ever dinner party in the new home they've just purchased in Oxford. The house isn't even fully unpacked yet; instead of a dining table, they rig up a surface on a pile of boxes. Piglet, a professional cookbook editor and accomplished home cook, is eager to impress their friends and welcome them into the life she and Kit are about to share together. But despite this charming opener, it soon becomes clear that there are cracks around the edges in Piglet and Kit's relationship. Piglet's friends don't really like Kit; the two come from vastly different socioeconomic backgrounds (highlighted even more as responsibilities for wedding finances come to the fore); and, to top it all off, just 13 days before they're scheduled to marry, Kit confesses a shocking betrayal. \"The propulsive train-headed-off-a-cliff nature of the narrative will keep people turning pages, but Piglet's vulnerability and resilience will be what readers remember.\" Piglet's response --- what with the expectations of her family, the financial investment of her in-laws, and the elaborate croquembouche she's decided to prepare herself --- is to collapse into a sort of numbness, neither confronting Kit nor forgiving him, exactly. But even as she counts down (with a sort of dread) to what should be the happiest day of her life, she can't envision putting the brakes on this elaborate event. When Piglet tells best friend Margot --- who has just given birth to her first child --- about what Kit has done, Margot puts her foot down, refusing to serve as matron of honor or even attend the wedding. Faced with the prospect of losing not only her fianc\u00e9 but also her best friend, Piglet marches toward her seemingly inevitable future not with anticipation but with dread. Piglet's nickname, as you might imagine, arises from a childhood story about the time she ate her younger sister's entire birthday cake to protect her from an emotionally difficult experience. Since then, Piglet has coped with other emotionally fraught situations in a similar vein, often traveling secretly to restaurants and ordering everything on the menu. Although PIGLET at times risks oversimplifying its central metaphor --- Piglet enjoys food to excess in order to try to compensate for her emotional emptiness --- the combination of Hazell's effective character development for Piglet and her descriptions of food more than salvage the novel. To call the food descriptions mouthwatering doesn't do them justice; they're both more complicated and, frankly, more baroque than that (the illustration of the overstuffed burger on the book jacket is a good tip-off). A scene where Piglet's soon-to-be in-laws tuck into a pork roast is horrific, and a late scene where Piglet finally cooks a pasta dinner solely for her own satisfaction is nothing short of redemptive. The propulsive train-headed-off-a-cliff nature of the narrative will keep people turning pages, but Piglet's vulnerability and resilience will be what readers remember.

            "review": " Maurice Carlos Ruffin\u2019s THE AMERICAN DAUGHTERS initially appears to be a fairly straightforward novel of the antebellum American South. The book opens as its protagonist, a young Black woman named Ady (called Antoinette by her white owner, du Marche), seems to be plotting some kind of action at a gathering of du Marche and his powerful white friends. The narrative then flashes back to Ady\u2019s childhood, to the strong relationship she had with her mother, Sanite, and the various ways in which Sanite strove to protect her while also trying to find some measure of freedom and safety despite their enslavement. Ady\u2019s childhood offers cycles of hope and tragedy. After a brief taste of freedom, on the run with her mother, she eventually finds herself back in du Marche\u2019s townhouse in New Orleans, where he continues to become more important in city government. \"The epilogue, framed as a transcript of a talk from an academic conference in 2172, sheds new light on Ady\u2019s story, as well as on the novel itself.\" For reasons that are unclear, least of all to Ady herself, du Marche decides to have Ady educated. He hires a governess to teach her to read and write in multiple languages, even though any literacy was illegal for enslaved people to possess. By inviting Ady to accompany him to an underground club called the Mockingbird, owned by a free Black woman named Leonore, du Marche also unwittingly introduces du Marche to the people and places that will change her life. Ady is immediately drawn to Lenore and feels welcomed and accepted by the diverse staff and guests at the Mockingbird. Unbeknownst to du Marche, she even begins working at the inn. In a city that is home to both enslaved people and many free Blacks, Lenore and her colleagues don\u2019t realize that Ady is one of the former. It\u2019s there that she discovers that Lenore and the tough-talking runaway, Alabama, are members of a nationwide underground network of female spies known as The Daughters. As signs of impending civil war begin to mount, The Daughters play intrinsic roles in seeding chaos and misinformation, helping to ensure that the Confederate forces never gain a sure foothold in New Orleans. As Ady\u2019s story progresses, the historical narrative is increasingly interrupted by other documents --- transcripts, memos, excerpts --- from more recent history and even from the future. The epilogue, framed as a transcript of a talk from an academic conference in 2172, sheds new light on Ady\u2019s story, as well as on the novel itself. It helps account for the somewhat rushed conclusion of the historical narrative and asks new questions about the truthfulness of Ady\u2019s narration. This metafictional approach offers additional depth to the novel and might even prompt some readers --- like those 22nd-century academics --- to flip back to the beginning of Ady\u2019s story and reread it with these questions in mind.

When Works Progress Administration (WPA) editor Millie Lang finds herself on the wrong end of a potential political scandal, she\u2019s shipped off to Montana to work on the state\u2019s American Guide Series --- travel books intended to put the nation\u2019s destitute writers to work. Millie arrives to an eclectic staff claiming their missed deadlines are due to sabotage, possibly from the state\u2019s powerful Copper Kings, who don\u2019t want their long and bloody history with union organizers aired for the rest of the country to read. But Millie begins to suspect that the answer might instead lie with the town\u2019s mysterious librarian, Alice Monroe. More than a decade earlier, Alice Monroe created the Boxcar Library in order to deliver books to isolated mining towns where men longed for entertainment and connection. Alice thought she found the perfect librarian to staff the train car in Colette Durand, a miner\u2019s daughter with a shotgun and too many secrets behind her eyes. Now, no one in Missoula will tell Millie why both Alice and Colette went out on the inaugural journey of the Boxcar Library, but only Alice returned. The three women\u2019s stories dramatically converge in the search to uncover what someone is so desperately trying to hide: what happened to Colette Durand. Inspired by the fascinating, true history of Missoula\u2019s Boxcar Library, the novel blends the story of the strong, courageous women who survived and thrived in the rough and rowdy West with that of the power of standing together to fight for workers\u2019 lives. And through it all shines the capacity of books to provide connection and light to those who need it most.",

            "review": " In the span of just a few years, Alex Michaelides has made quite a name for himself. He has seen his first two novels, THE SILENT PATIENT and THE MAIDENS, reach global bestseller status, with each being optioned for film adaptations. This brings us to his third effort, THE FURY, which is another well-conceived work of psychological suspense. It pays homage to classic mystery/thrillers that surely will bring about comparisons to the writings of Agatha Christie and Patricia Highsmith, among others. In fact, the book shares many characteristics of Highsmith\u2019s THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. I was hooked from page one! \"[THE FURY] pays homage to classic mystery/thrillers that surely will bring about comparisons to the writings of Agatha Christie and Patricia Highsmith, among others.... Alex Michaelides has penned quite the stunner of a psychological thriller.\" Elliot Chase is a playwright who mentions up front that one should \u201cnever open a book with the weather.\u201d This is said in reference to \u201cthe Fury,\u201d the sharp and deadly winds that strike the Greek islands where the action mainly takes place. Elliot is far from a reliable narrator, which allows Michaelides to toy with readers and keep them guessing right up to the denouement. While Elliot may be the narrator, Lana Farrar is the star. She was a once-famous movie actress who is married to her second husband, Jason Miller, but she doesn\u2019t fully trust him. Lana decides to have some fun, so she invites Elliot and fellow actress Kate Crosby to a mini-vacation at Aura, the house that she and her first husband own on a private island in Greece. The only other people there are Nikos, the caretaker, and Agathi, the cook and housekeeper. THE FURY jumps back and forth in time, which only makes the somewhat unreliable narration that much trickier to follow. One thing\u2019s for sure: Jason is having an affair, and all signs point to the other woman being Kate. This should make for a lonely and uncomfortable holiday, especially when the fury of the Greek winds picks up and all are bound to the island without any means of leaving. It\u2019s very reminiscent of Christie\u2019s AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. One night, gunshots are heard on the island. Murder has come to Aura. Things get really interesting as the story approaches its second act, especially since Elliot is not to be completely believed about anything. While the small group searches the island for the \u201cintruder\u201d who must have been behind the slaying, the weather worsens as do the temperaments of those who are remaining. Fingers are pointed, no one is to be trusted, and secrets and revelations are sure to spill out. Alex Michaelides has penned quite the stunner of a psychological thriller. Readers of his first two books should catch the clever Easter egg references to those titles in this narrative, which makes for a nice private fictional worldbuilding. There is not much more I can reveal here without entering spoiler territory. All I will say is that Michaelides has yet another must-read hit on his hands. Reviewed by Ray Palen on January 19, 2024",

            "review": " Robyn Harding, the bestselling author of THE SWAP and THE DROWNING WOMAN, returns with another complex, twisted psychological thriller. THE HATERS is about what happens when hate, obsession and cancel culture combine to take down one woman at the height of her career. After years of effort, hard work and struggle, single mom Camryn Lane can finally say that she has \u201cmade it.\u201d Her debut novel, Burnt Orchid, has been published, and she is preparing to celebrate her first-ever book launch. The book, which follows a teenage gang leader turned politician\u2019s wife, has received rave reviews, with the New York Times Book Review calling it \u201cchilling, heart-wrenching and painfully authentic\u201d and heralding Camryn as a \u201cbrave new voice in fiction.\u201d Her publisher is thrilled, her agent is eager for her next book, and, best of all, her boyfriend, best friend and teenage daughter are all proud of her. But then, just as Camryn is about to take the stage, an email arrives in her author account, not only calling the book \u201cmindless garbage\u201d but accusing her of exploiting her job as a high school counselor to pen it. Like any new author, she was advised to expect bad reviews, but this one seems strangely personal. Nevertheless, the show must go on. The launch is a hit, but unfortunately for Camryn, it also marks the last time that her book will bring her any joy. \"Reading a new book about a new book makes THE HATERS a truly immersive experience... Robyn Harding gets better with each book, and here she has struck the perfect balance of fun, riveting, timely and seriously twisted.\" Camryn becomes obsessed with the sender of the vicious email: Ingrid Wandry. Her publisher advises her not to engage, and fortunately, Camryn\u2019s day job as a counselor at Maple Heights Secondary School keeps her busy. The teenagers she works with have academic, social and behavioral issues, and one case in particular has been consuming her lately. Maple Heights has a dedicated mean girl, Fiona Carmichael, and her bullying recently has caused another girl, Abby Lester, to take a leave of absence from school. After yet another failed attempt to elicit remorse from Fiona, Camryn tells the teen to return to class, but not before Fiona responds: \u201cYou know a lot about kids and their problems,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why your book was so real.\u201d Her words, Camryn notes, bear a striking similarity to the nasty email she received. But that\u2019s crazy, right? Already on edge, Camryn makes a rookie author mistake: checking reader reviews on a popular book website. Buried beneath the four- and five-star reviews lie a slew of one-star reviews, each of them remarking on Camryn\u2019s role as a counselor and what she may or may not have lifted straight from her vulnerable students\u2019 lives. Camryn knows her teens are going through a lot, but they certainly aren\u2019t gang leaders exploiting other homeless teens or corrupt politicians\u2019 wives. So the comparisons to her book seem outlandish at first, but she can\u2019t ignore the old adage to \u201cwrite what you know.\u201d Did she unintentionally exploit her role? And if so, can she repair the damage? A talk with her publicist assuages her fears somewhat, and Camryn is left with explicit directions to ignore the bad, revel in the good, and get to work on her next book. Which is easier said than done. Still obsessed with Ingrid Wandry, Camryn goes to terrific lengths to find the woman behind the reviews who is wreaking havoc on her personal life and calling into question her own sanity. Her friends and loved ones, supportive of her but tired of playing second-string to her book, are fed up, and the tension that once resided solely online has started to creep into every avenue of her life. Her ex-husband and his new wife seem to know more about her daughter, Liz, and her wishes than she does; Liz refuses to confide in her; and her boyfriend, Theo, is tired of coming last in her life. Even her writing group seems annoyed, with some of them visibly jealous of her success and others critical of her decision to learn the identity of her hater. Camryn\u2019s hater, sensing that their words are having an effect, only ramps up the attacks, but never in a way that would warrant police intervention. The combination of personal and career stress forms a pressure cooker. As the online abuse becomes even more personal and real, Camryn\u2019s mental state suffers, and she makes, well, reckless choices. But is this exactly what her hater wants, or can she still make them see that she is a good person? Can she even still call herself a good person after stalking her own stalker? Harding alternates between Camryn\u2019s life and chapters from Burnt Orchid, keeping the tension taut, the reveals gut-punching and the mystery of Camryn\u2019s hater compelling. Reading a new book about a new book makes THE HATERS a truly immersive experience, and it is hard at times not to pause to wonder about the one-star reviews currently being written about the book in your hands\u2026and the lengths to which any of these haters will take their criticisms. Harding does a tremendous job of highlighting the ways in which social media bullying can destabilize one\u2019s mental state. Although Camryn makes (often jaw-droppingly) bad choices at times, Harding makes it easy to enter her thoughts and understand her actions, even if you don\u2019t agree with them. Occasionally in these kinds of thrillers, where one person appears to have the worst luck imaginable, it can seem as if an author is piling on. After all, who can say that they\u2019ve had their book attacked at the same time that their daughter reveals her plans to defer college and their boyfriend decides he wants to take their relationship to the next level? Yet Harding develops each of her plot threads with gorgeous, refined control, never leaving storylines to wither or allowing one to outshine the other. The result is tantalizing, dynamic and downright chilling. Author or not, if you don\u2019t at least consider deleting your social media (or taking those one-star reviews with a whole shaker of salt) after reading THE HATERS, you have a stronger stomach than this reviewer. Robyn Harding gets better with each book, and here she has struck the perfect balance of fun, riveting, timely and seriously twisted. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on July 13, 2024",

            "review": " Constance Haverhill is spending the summer at Hazelbourne-on-Sea on the English coast. But in the summer of 1919, things are not as joyous for her as they could be. While World War I has ended and everyone is happy to have the soldiers return home, it also means that much of her independence, and her work, will be taken from her so the men will have jobs when they come back. With her brother estranged and her mother\u2019s death still heavy in her thoughts, her summer at the sea is not what she expected. \"You\u2019ll fall in love with the characters and the setting, and you won\u2019t want to put it down until the last word is read.\" While her older companion is resting, Constance stops by the hotel restaurant for lunch. In a fortuitous meeting, Poppy Wirrall unexpectedly livens up her summer. Poppy is the proprietor of the Hazelbourne Ladies Motorcycle Club (to which she plans to add flying lessons) and employs several local women as part of her taxi service. Constance, Poppy and the ladies of the club become fast friends, giving Constance something to think about other than her rather bleak future as a possible governess, which she is not interested in exploring as a career choice. Poppy, the daughter of a local baronet, continually flaunts convention, sometimes to the chagrin of her family and friends, but shows Constance a version of the future she didn\u2019t consider. As summer rolls to a close, Constance\u2019s life changes in ways she never imagined. She becomes an honorary member of the Hazelbourne Ladies Motorcycle Club and helps her companion, Mrs. Fog, rekindle a long-lost romance. And even Constance begins to build her own future. The friendships she thought would be fleeting are turning out to be very real and even life-altering. Just a few pages into the book, it felt like I knew these characters all my life. Helen Simonson has a way of welcoming in a reader, showing just enough so you\u2019re quickly invested in what happens right from the start. Constance is quiet but strong, and while she might doubt her future, you never do. THE HAZELBOURNE LADIES MOTORCYCLE AND FLYING CLUB is a wonderful read with some love stories intertwined alongside the friendships, and even a few sad moments that remind the reader that World War I was not far off for these people. This book is a perfect summer companion whether you\u2019re on the beach or sitting in the backyard. You\u2019ll fall in love with the characters and the setting, and you won\u2019t want to put it down until the last word is read. Reviewed by Amy Gwiazdowski on May 31, 2024",

            "review": " Jodi Bishop needs a break. She\u2019s the breadwinner in her family; her mother, Audrey, has Parkinson\u2019s disease; and her older sister, Tracy, is too flighty to count on. Her husband Harrison\u2019s first novel was a success, but he\u2019s having trouble finishing his second, and resents having to care for their two young children when realtor Jodi has to work weekends showing houses or spend time with her parents. Her cantankerous father, Vic, denies that he needs help caring for her mother, but he is 79 and their home is large. What they need, obviously, is a housekeeper --- one that Vic will accept. \"Jodi is a very likable and relatable character, and the novel delivers on its promise to wrap things up satisfactorily, but not without many juicy twists along the way.\" Enter Elyse Woodley. She\u2019s an energetic, kind and fit 62-year-old with glowing references. Her father agrees to a trial run with Elyse and is soon won over by freshly baked brownies, sheer competence and maybe a little flirting. Elyse seems too good to be true, and Jodi can\u2019t believe their luck at first. \u201cIn the end, I have only myself to blame. I\u2019m the one who let her in.\u201d We know early on that this housekeeper is not what she seems. The question is how she will be unmasked and (we increasingly hope) punished. Even with Elyse firmly ensconced in her parents\u2019 household, the pressure on Jodi\u2019s marriage doesn\u2019t let up. She is suspicious of the young, adoring woman Wren, who signs up for Harrison\u2019s summer fiction workshop. Harrison runs hot and cold with Jodi, and she worries that their fights are scaring their children. Jodi remembers her own fear as a child hearing her parents\u2019 loud arguments. Tracy --- tall, thin and pretty --- was the favorite, and every interaction she has with her parents reminds her of that fact. Her dad always has a comment about Jodi\u2019s weight, and her mother (when she can still talk) calls her Tracy. Even with Elyse in place, she\u2019s getting no relief from the pressures in her life. So when handsome divorcee Roger engages her services to find a high-end condo, she is only too susceptible to his charms. Perhaps the most interesting relationship in this novel is the one between Jodi and Tracy. Tracy is 45 and still living off a generous allowance from their wealthy father. Even though she\u2019s the favorite, she is loathe to visit her ailing mother. As the situation with her parents and the housekeeper escalates, she pesters Jodi to safeguard not their health, but the wealth that she expects to inherit. Despite all of this, Jodi loves her sister. She loves her dad, too, even though he shows no love for her. There are a lot of balls in the air, and I couldn\u2019t wait to see how and where they landed. Jodi is a very likable and relatable character, and the novel delivers on its promise to wrap things up satisfactorily, but not without many juicy twists along the way.

After suffering a psychotic break that ruined friendships, stalled her fledgling restaurant and forced her to move out of her comfortable flat, she\u2019ll do anything to get back to normal. She and her partner, Felix --- who has been a saint through her recent troubles --- move into a new flat for a fresh start. Nancy is taking her pills, seeing her therapist and avoiding unnecessary stress. She\u2019s doing absolutely everything right, but something is still very, very wrong. On the first day in the new flat, she hears them again --- the mysterious voices that triggered her first episode. It could just be the unfamiliar sounds of water in the pipes, or the screaming baby across the hall, but deep down she knows something more sinister is going on. Her fears are confirmed when the young woman in the downstairs flat, Kira, is found dead. Felix, her neighbors and even the police insist it\u2019s a tragic suicide, but the pieces aren\u2019t adding up for Nancy. Can she trust her own instincts, or is it all in her head? Meanwhile, Detective Inspector Maud O\u2019Connor has misgivings about her colleagues\u2019 investigation of Kira\u2019s death. The boys club at the top seems intent on closing the case as quickly as possible, especially since the only person who thinks it could be anything other than suicide is known to be unreliable. But Maud knows what it\u2019s like to be dismissed as an overemotional woman and isn\u2019t so quick to discount Nancy\u2019s claims. As tensions reach an explosive breaking point, the line between fact and delusion becomes dangerously blurred, but Maud will stop at nothing to ensure that the truth comes to light.",

            "review": " As fascinating as THE MURDER OF MR. MA is, the afterword and acknowledgments are almost as intriguing as the actual mystery itself. Written by John Shen Yen Nee and S. J. Rozan, this series opener introduces two Chinese men who are actual figures from China's past. Lao She and Judge Dee Ren Jie collaborate to investigate the homicide of a Chinese man. Subsequently, more Chinese men, all of whom knew each other, are found murdered by the same weapon --- an unusual butterfly sword. The setting is 1920s London, and we can feel the damp, the crowds, and the hustle and bustle of the busy city streets as Lao and Dee navigate different neighborhoods in search of the killer. The novel is told in the first person from She's point of view, and the beautifully written but rather stilted period language reminds us that it's not modern-day UK. We clearly understand the prejudice that the Chinese endured as pejorative terms are used regarding them, and they are all viewed as long-nailed, opium-addicted, rat-eating monsters. \"The plot is extremely clever, and for much of it, we are led astray by cunningly placed red herrings. But the clues are there, and the final unveiling of the villain is perfectly planned and executed.\" Our protagonists, though, are far from the stereotypical Chinese of that time. They dress in tweed suits --- as do the most uptight, well-to-do Londoners --- and speak proper King's English. Lao is a professor of Chinese language at the university, and Dee is a judge in China, although he was living in France at the opening of the story. Through the narrative, we learn a lot about the role of the Chinese in World War I. While they ostensibly did not engage in actual fighting, they were hired by the British to dig trenches and build necessary shelters at the front of the battle. And while their work contracts specifically stipulated that they were not to be directly exposed to the fighting, that was ignored. In fact, as we see from the attitude of many British at that time, Chinese lives were expendable. The only lives that really mattered were British lives, so if the Chinese were harmed in their work at the front, the British felt that it was no great loss. Through the eyes of those men in the story, we see the thousands of years of culture and art that the Chinese created, which is their history. Their brilliance is clearly depicted in the character of Dee, whose dedication to solving the murders and trying to protect those men he knows is admirable. Dee knew the victims when they were working as Chinese laborers at the front in France. He was hired to deal with conflicts, make certain that the terms of the contracts were adhered to, and protect the working men from abuse. Too often, though, he was the one who suffered abuse in his heroic efforts to ensure their safety. So when these same individuals are being killed, Dee feels a burning need to bring the perpetrator to justice. The plot is extremely clever, and for much of it, we are led astray by cunningly placed red herrings. But the clues are there, and the final unveiling of the villain is perfectly planned and executed. With a very unexpected addition. Perhaps the best part is that we know there will be more mysteries to solve with these two intriguing characters. I look forward to seeing how their relationship grows and how their teamwork develops. Reviewed by Pamela Kramer on April 13, 2024",

Summer Sullivan, the youngest founding member of Elm Creek Quilts, has spent the last two years pursuing a master\u2019s degree in history at the University of Chicago. Her unexpected return home to the celebrated quilter\u2019s retreat is met with delight but also concern from her mother, Gwen; her best friend, Sarah; master quilter Sylvia; and her other colleagues --- and rightly so. Stymied by writer\u2019s block, Summer hasn\u2019t finished her thesis, and she can\u2019t graduate until she does. Elm Creek Manor offers respite while Summer struggles to meet her extended deadline. She finds welcome distraction in organizing an exhibit of antique quilts as a fundraiser to renovate Union Hall, the 1863 Greek Revival headquarters of the Waterford Historical Society. But Summer\u2019s research uncovers startling facts about Waterford\u2019s past, prompting unsettling questions about racism, economic injustice, and political corruption within their community, past and present. As Summer\u2019s work progresses, quilt lovers and history buffs praise the growing collection, but affronted local leaders demand that she remove all references to Waterford\u2019s troubled history. As controversy threatens the exhibit\u2019s success, Summer fears that her pursuit of the truth might cost the Waterford Historical Society their last chance to save Union Hall. Her only hope is to rally the quilting community to her cause. THE MUSEUM OF LOST QUILTS is a warm and deeply moving story about the power of collective memory. With every fascinating quilt she studies, Summer finds her passion for history renewed --- and discovers a promising new future for herself.",

From her cell in a mysterious convent, a woman writes the story of her life in whatever she can find --- discarded ink, dirt, even her own blood. A lower member of the Sacred Sisterhood, deemed an unworthy, she dreams of ascending to the ranks of the Enlightened at the center of the convent and of pleasing the foreboding Superior Sister. Outside, the world is plagued by catastrophe --- cities are submerged underwater, electricity and the internet are nonexistent, and bands of survivors fight and forage in a cruel, barren landscape. Inside, the narrator is controlled and punished, but safe. But when a stranger makes her way past the convent walls, joining the ranks of the unworthy, she forces the narrator to consider her long-buried past --- and what she may be overlooking about the Enlightened. As the two women grow closer, the narrator is increasingly haunted by questions about her own past, the environmental future and her present life inside the convent. How did she get to the Sacred Sisterhood? Why can\u2019t she remember her life before? And what really happens when a woman is chosen as one of the Enlightened? A searing, dystopian tale about climate crisis, ideological extremism, and the tidal pull of our most violent, exploitative instincts, this is another unforgettable novel from a master of feminist horror.",

            "review": " Cory Leadbeater had just applied for a position as a personal assistant to famed author Joan Didion. He didn\u2019t know it would turn into an eight-year friendship that would be life-affirming. Cory hailed from a lower-middle-class family in Jersey City. His relationship with his father can be aptly described as night and day. There were times when Cory accompanied him to his job and enjoyed every second with him. But then there were days when Cory was the target of his abuse. The relationship between them would leave a lasting impact on Cory\u2019s mindset in the coming years. \"Cory Leadbeater\u2019s prose is evocative of a seasoned scribe. His story is touching but also inspiring as the reader follows his emotional journey of self-discovery. This outstanding memoir merits a large audience.\" Cory\u2019s life consisted of contrasting highs and lows, coupling the great news with the tragic. When he learned about the job with Joan, his father was facing heavy jail time for committing mortgage fraud. Cory\u2019s family was in grave financial peril due to his father\u2019s legal problems. The personal assistant position gave Cory some monetary relief as Joan provided a room in her Manhattan apartment for Cory to stay in along with a decent salary. Their instantaneous rapport cemented his employment and began their friendship. As a personal assistant, Cory\u2019s duties included putting order into Joan\u2019s chaotic professional and personal life. He also would organize her social calendar and take care of her shopping and meal ordering. Joan was a renowned author of both fiction and nonfiction works and was still sought after for her wit and charm in her golden years. Cory and Joan often would discuss literature and music over a cocktail. Despite these good times, the frustrations of life niggled at Cory and led him to heavy drinking and depression. An obsession with death while denying the best of life nearly consumed him. Cory had questioned times in his past and whether he was living a real or pretend reality. A character of his own creation began to stalk his waking moments. His inability to reconcile death with life and repair a broken relationship with his dad further brought him to the brink. Yet the loving relationships he had with his future wife, Liz; his mother; Joan; and his friends provided the impetus to keep going. THE UPTOWN LOCAL is a story not only of friendship but also about a man learning to break free from his past and his inner demons. The crux of this often poignant account takes place during the nearly decade-long period when Cory worked with and befriended Joan Didion. At the beginning of their relationship, he is a burgeoning writer clamoring to share his words with the world. The exasperation that he experiences as a struggling author is palpable with every rejection. Joan becomes an almost surrogate mother to Cory and provides constant encouragement and constructive criticism. Cory Leadbeater\u2019s prose is evocative of a seasoned scribe. His story is touching but also inspiring as the reader follows his emotional journey of self-discovery. This outstanding memoir merits a large audience. Reviewed by Philip Zozzaro on July 19, 2024",

            "review": " In THE WHARTON PLOT, Mariah Fredericks turns her meticulous eye for plot and rigorous research to post\u2013Gilded Age New York City, in which bestselling author Edith Wharton has stumbled upon a mystery for the ages. It is 1911, and it has been six years since Wharton\u2019s explosive novel, THE HOUSE OF MIRTH, released to rave reviews and a ravenous public. Since then, Wharton has shilled out a few new stories, but her publisher, Scribner, is hungry for her next big book. There\u2019s just one problem: Wharton, heralded for sharing her insider's knowledge of upper-class New York and realistic portrayals of the Gilded Age, has grown tired of New York. She fears that the city has sped past her and that she no longer has the boots-on-the-ground knowledge to depict it accurately. Electric motors abound, glamorous old buildings are being knocked down for new monstrosities, and the city is just so crowded that there seems to be no room for inspiration. Add to that her husband\u2019s bad health, the rumors of her own affair, and her age (a whopping, practically dead 49 years), and you have a serious case of writer\u2019s block. \"Fredericks clearly had a great deal of fun writing her protagonist, but her research and ability to craft entire worlds in only a few sentences ground this fun while making readers feel right at home.\" When we meet Wharton, she is being observed by her editor, Mr. Brownell, who drew the short straw in deciding which of Scribner\u2019s representatives would be forced to dine with the incorrigible author. He notes, with a critical but warm gaze, her effusive furs and jewels --- not to mention the dismissive attitude she takes with the waitstaff --- and prepares for battle. However, no sooner than the two have begun to discuss her future at Scribner than Mr. Brownell is distracted by another guest at the restaurant: David Graham Phillips. An avowed muckraker journalist and author, Phillips has been both praised and criticized for his unwavering dedication to uncovering corruption and wrongdoing in the government. His book, THE TREASON OF THE SENATE, prompted both Congressional and presidential outrage. Already feeling insecure, Wharton is unsettled by the pompous Mr. Phillips, who introduces himself as America\u2019s leading novelist before insulting her background as a member of the elite and not so politely informing her that she has no idea how to write or understand the American woman. Despite his rudeness, Phillips sticks in Wharton\u2019s mind, perhaps a welcome distraction from her own worries. That is, until her editor phones her to let her know that Phillips has been shot --- in broad daylight --- in front of the Princeton Club. Intrigued and admittedly a bit voyeuristic, Wharton attends his funeral and meets his grieving sister before being invited to his apartment for a repast. It is there that she learns something even more shocking than an author being murdered: Phillips had been receiving threatening notes and calls for months leading up to the publication of his next novel, SUSAN LENOX: Her Rise and Fall. His sister and a few of his followers believe that it was this book that led to his murder. Knowing that a grieving sibling will get no respect at Phillips\u2019 publisher, she pleads with Wharton to do what is right and ensure that the book is published as he wrote it --- with no cuts for propriety, no excuses and no freedom for his killer. If you\u2019re anything like Wharton, this leaves you with one question: What exactly was in Phillips\u2019 novel? \u201cThe truth,\u201d his sister replies. Although there was no love lost between Wharton and Phillips, Wharton has grown tired of sabotaging publishers and the lack of recognition for the written word, especially as the world moves so speedily to progress and revolution. So she decides it is only right that she help Phillips and his family see the publication of his last book. Indulging in the proximity and advice of contemporaries like Henry James, Walter Berry and Morton Fullerton, she turns from writer to investigator. But when threatening notes --- on the same cardstock, in the same hand, and written with the same writerly bent --- begin arriving at her own home, Wharton must wonder what Phillips was really up to and if her late involvement could mean her own death. Readers of THE LINDBERGH NANNY will already know that Mariah Fredericks is an astute and meticulous researcher who has a knack for writing characters who live and breathe on the page. In THE WHARTON PLOT, these talents are once again on full display. This time, though, she takes her plot a step further by putting her audience not just near the drama, but right in the head of the esteemed literary figure investigating it: Edith Wharton. Fredericks is ambitious but assured as she observes the world of post\u2013Gilded Age New York through her protagonist\u2019s eyes, and the result is astounding. Wharton absolutely crackles off the page, and her observations of her contemporaries read exactly like those of the writer of works like THE HOUSE OF MIRTH and ETHAN FROME. Fredericks clearly had a great deal of fun writing her protagonist, but her research and ability to craft entire worlds in only a few sentences ground this fun while making readers feel right at home. Add to that the multiple other issues plaguing Wharton --- her marriage, her affair, her career --- and you have a well-rounded, deeply entertaining work of historical fiction that just so happens to include a major mystery. Fredericks continues to impress, and I cannot wait to see which historical mystery she turns her eye toward next. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on January 27, 2024",

It is 20 years after the catastrophic war between the United States and China that brought down the old American political order. A new party has emerged in the US, one that\u2019s held power for over a decade. Efforts to cement its grip have resulted in mounting violent resistance. The American president has control of the media, but he is beginning to lose control of the streets. Many fear he\u2019ll stop at nothing to remain in the White House. Suddenly, he collapses in the middle of an address to the nation. After an initial flurry of misinformation, the administration reluctantly announces his death. A cover-up ensues, conspiracy theories abound, and the country descends into a new type of civil war. A handful of elite actors from the worlds of computer science, intelligence and business have a fairly good idea what happened. All signs point to a profound breakthrough in AI, of which the remote assassination of an American president is hardly the most game-changing ramification. The trail leads to an outpost in the Amazon rainforest, the last known whereabouts of the tech visionary who predicted this breakthrough. As some of the world\u2019s great powers, old and new, state and nonstate alike, struggle to outmaneuver one another in this new Great Game of scientific discovery, the outcome becomes entangled with the fate of American democracy. Combining a deep understanding of AI, biotech and the possibility of a coming Singularity, along with their signature geopolitical sophistication, Elliot Ackerman and Admiral James Stavridis have once again written a visionary work. 2054 is a novel that reads like a thriller even as it demands that we consider the trajectory of our society and its potentially calamitous destination.",

When innkeeper Dorthe Hyllested is found murdered, the police are surprised and puzzled to discover a concealed nursery in her upstairs apartment. As far as her friends and family knew, the recently widowed Dorthe was childless --- so who lived in this secret toy-strewn room? And more importantly, where is the child now? Detective Louise Rick has just taken on a challenging new job as head of the freshly created Mobile Task Unit, which is charged with solving the most difficult cases all over Denmark. With Dorthe\u2019s murder as her first investigation and the clock ticking to find the missing child, Louise is dismayed to learn that none of her handpicked group of seasoned investigators have been approved for transfer to her new unit. Instead, she must cobble together a brand-new, unproven team from a group of officers she\u2019s never met. Worst of all, the case will necessitate collaborating with the Missing Persons Department --- which will mean working closely with Louise\u2019s former fianc\u00e9, Eik, who abruptly broke things off last year, leaving her devastated. Could the mystery of Dorthe\u2019s murder and the hidden child have something to do with the cabin in the woods behind the inn where men are often seen coming and going at all hours? With no witnesses to Dorthe\u2019s murder and no real leads, and an unproven and potentially untrustworthy team behind her, Louise finds herself grasping at unlikely connections --- but the twisted story she begins to uncover turns out to be darker and more dangerous than she ever imagined.",

A VERY PRIVATE SCHOOL offers a clear-eyed, firsthand account of a culture of cruelty at the school Charles Spencer attended in his youth and provides important insights into an antiquated boarding system. Drawing on the memories of many of his schoolboy contemporaries, as well as his own letters and diaries from the time, he reflects on the hopelessness and abandonment he felt at age eight, viscerally describing the intense pain of homesickness and the appalling inescapability of it all. Exploring the long-lasting impact of his experiences, Spencer presents a candid reckoning with his past and a reclamation of his childhood.",

Marooned in a stifling job (she\u2019s a celebrity gossip columnist for an online magazine), striking out at bad first date after bad first date, Frankie has watched her friends and former boyfriends couple up, marry off, have kids and move to the suburbs, while she continues to lead her fabulous single lifestyle in London all alone. But Frankie hardly has time to contend with this existential crisis before --- in the wake of yet another terrible first date --- she trips on the front step of her favorite kebab shop and dies of a subdural hematoma. \"Helly Acton's BEGIN AGAIN will appeal to fans of the TV show 'The Good Place,' as well as novels such as OONA OUT OF ORDER and IN FIVE YEARS.\" However, that\u2019s not the end of Frankie\u2019s story. In fact, it might be just the beginning as she wakes up in a place called The Station. A sort of spiritual conductor named Mabel tells her that, after reviewing her case, the powers that be have decided to give her one more chance --- actually, five of them --- to see what her life might look like had she made different choices (or any choice at all) instead of just coasting through the way she has been. Soon, Frankie is zipping back to the same August night, hours before her demise. But in each case, she is dropped into a different version of reality. In one, she has decided not to turn down an opportunity to live abroad and teach English language learners in Mexico. In another, she accepts the marriage proposal of her first serious boyfriend. In yet another, she is living in Los Angeles with a media mogul and appears to have had a lot of plastic surgery. During each new lease on life, Frankie starts out optimistic and even excited, convinced that this version of her life is the one that\u2019s worth living for, the one that shows her definitively where her past self took a wrong turn. But, perhaps inevitably, in the course of just a few hours, she soon discovers that not all is paradise in this different reality. Places, experiences and, most importantly, people from her \u201creal\u201d life are absent here. Helly Acton's BEGIN AGAIN will appeal to fans of the TV show \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d as well as novels such as OONA OUT OF ORDER and IN FIVE YEARS. Frankie\u2019s perspective is witty, a bit manic and self-deprecating in a humorous way. She is a character who is blind to some faults and hyperaware of others. Readers will be cheering for her to make, if not the \u201cperfect\u201d choice, choices that will sustain her and bring about the future she deserves. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on April 20, 2024",

            ],
            "review": " The nickname \u201cCharlie Hustle\u201d was originally meant as an insult offered by none other than Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford, both Hall of Famers for the New York Yankees, when they saw Pete Rose sprinting down to first base after a walk in a 1963 spring training game. But it was nevertheless appropriate: no one hustled more than Pete Rose. On and off the field it seems, as reported in Keith O\u2019Brien\u2019s expansive new biography on the disgraced ballplayer. Rose was born to be a hero, growing up in Cincinnati with a father who himself was a local sports legend, albeit an amateur. His dad instilled in him the notions of hard work and self-demanding excellence. So it was perhaps inevitable that he persevered until he eventually became the all-time hit king, wresting that title away from Ty Cobb, an intense ballplayer from the early 1900s. (Rose\u2019s collision with catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All-Star game mirrored Cobb\u2019s hell-bent-for-leather attitude on the base paths.) \"Most of CHARLIE HUSTLE deals with Rose, the scrappy player. But as the chapters go on, gambling becomes an increasing part of the narrative as more and more outsiders are brought in to play various roles.... O\u2019Brien\u2019s work is extremely well-researched.\" Rose started his career prior to the free agency era that removed barriers as players began calling the shots as to where they might want to play. He was a main cog of \u201cThe Big Red Machine\u201d teams that dominated the early to mid-'70s. His ego told him that he was never paid what he was worth, so fans should have known that despite his allegiance to Cincinnati, he had to go where the money was. That was necessitated in part by his gambling addiction. \u201cHustle,\u201d in addition to his nickname, was his behind-the-scenes persona. O\u2019Brien, a New York Times bestselling author, lets us know early on that Rose had a penchant for betting on football games, horse races and dog races --- a \u201ctripleheader\u201d as he called it. As the paychecks increased, so did the money he wagered (and often lost). Gambling in and of itself is not a big deal. Many players do it, and certainly pro sports has embraced betting businesses as sponsors, which is kind of ironic. Ever since the 1919 Black Sox scandal in which eight players on the Chicago White Sox were banned from the game for allegedly taking payoffs to lose the World Series (against the Reds, no less), the one rule over all others is \u201cNever bet on baseball.\u201d But in Rose\u2019s mind, either the rules didn\u2019t apply to him or he thought he was smart enough to get away with it. It turns out that neither was the case. Once it was discovered that he had bet on baseball, including his own team, Major League Baseball came down hard. (Rose had returned to Cincinnati as a player-manager, so the decisions he made could have made a difference in the outcome of games, win or lose.) Most of CHARLIE HUSTLE deals with Rose, the scrappy player. But as the chapters go on, gambling becomes an increasing part of the narrative as more and more outsiders are brought in to play various roles. My first thought upon learning that this book was in the pipeline was: \u201cDo we really need another biography of this man? What is left to say about him?\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s work is extremely well-researched. Yet there\u2019s no real drama here. Any baseball fan of that era knows the story of Rose\u2019s banishment and his chances of being inducted into the Hall of Fame, which would have been a no-brainer. In his Author\u2019s Note, O\u2019Brien writes, \u201cThis story is a work of nonfiction\u2026\u201d That immediately raised one eyebrow for me. Why would you have to include that? Would anyone think this was a novel? There are a few flaws here, the most obvious of which has to do with the number of kids Rose fathered. He was a serial womanizer, conducting several assignations while married to his first wife, as well as his second. O\u2019Brien reports that one of the longer-running girlfriends had a baby by Rose, which accounts for a paternity suit and several pages in the book, yet he neglects to include that one when referring to Rose\u2019s offspring. For all the investigating he has done, O\u2019Brien seems to leave out the names of a number of people involved in the chain of events. They must exist somewhere, so why omit them? Another has to do with the designation of Rose\u2019s first minor league assignments. In the early '60s, the lowest level was Class D, but O\u2019Brien refers to it in a few spots as \u201cA-ball, Class D.\u201d Are these minor points? It depends on how you look at it. Many readers might be totally unaware of these errors, but if O\u2019Brien wants his book to be taken seriously by baseball historians, then, yes, it\u2019s important. Even the subtitle is wearying: \u201cThe Last Glory Days of Baseball.\u201d Anyone who reads my blog on the literature of the game knows my feelings about such claims. Who\u2019s to say there are no glory days yet to come? Reviewed by Ron Kaplan (www.RonKaplansBaseballBookshelf.com) on May 11, 2024",

            "review": " Anna Gazmarian shares hard-won revelations --- some emotionally harrowing and others spiritually uplifting --- in DEVOUT, a memoir of disability and determination. Receiving a diagnosis of ADHD in grade school when she found it impossible to sit still or refrain from talking, Gazmarian would face challenge after challenge. Absorbing the fundamental religion of her family, she began to fear that she was possessed by demons. She also questioned if those who sought relief from distress and disease from Jesus were possibly suffering from the sort of mental torments that would plague her for many years. \"DEVOUT will touch readers who suffer from psychological difficulties, as well as those who simply wish to emulate her rare combination of strength and tenderness.\" Seeking help from doctors, Gazmarian was prescribed drugs that at times seemed to offer no relief. She would be advised by other medical professionals to stop taking all such drugs, and sometimes she herself would choose to take or not take them. She was often deeply depressed, feeling shame for her diagnosis, which later would evolve into bipolar disorder and continuing to look for comfort within her Christian faith. Gazmarian developed her writing talents while in college, helping her to see her personal dilemmas as transformative when put in poetic form. Meeting her husband-to-be, David, she found love, commonality of perspective and remarkable communication.\u00a0With Gazmarian still battling her disorder and David sometimes lunging into his own bouts of depression, they joined a religious group that gave them a sense of increasing inner and outer approval. Her spiritual life deepened when she gave birth and has continued to reward her with a sense of hope, expressed plainly and poignantly in these vibrant recollections. Gazmarian has developed a career in creative writing, with essays and journalistic pieces appearing in notable publications such as The Sun and The Guardian. It is clear from this engaging memoir that she has moved even farther into the realm of poignant and piquant prose, conveying here both the humor and the horror of her struggles. DEVOUT will touch readers who suffer from psychological difficulties, as well as those who simply wish to emulate her rare combination of strength and tenderness. The book concludes with a message for Gazmarian\u2019s child, offering the wisdom that \u201cthis world gives us plenty of reasons to stop, pay attention, and let awe overwhelm us.\u201d Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott on March 16, 2024",

In GHOST DOGS, Dubus\u2019 nonfiction prowess is on full display in his retelling of his own successes, failures, triumphs and pain. In his longest essay, \u201cIf I Owned a Gun,\u201d Dubus reflects on the empowerment and shame he felt in keeping a gun, and his decision, ultimately, to give it up. Elsewhere, he writes of a violent youth and of settled domesticity and fatherhood, about the omnipresent expectations and contradictions of masculinity, about the things writers remember and those they forget. Drawing upon kindred literary spirits from Rilke to Rumi to Tim O\u2019Brien, GHOST DOGS renders moments of personal revelation with emotional generosity and stylistic grace, ultimately standing as essential witness and testimony to the art of the essay.",

Luckily, Frank isn\u2019t interested in the lifeless body in Jim\u2019s car. Frank has a proposition: he\u2019ll make the dead man disappear if Jim helps take down Elmer Kobb, who is vying for city commissioner and willing to backstab anyone who gets in his way. Soon, Jim and Frank are sucked into a seedy world of crime and corruption, where no one is safe and nothing is what it seems.

            "review": " Helen Oyeyemi is one of those novelists whose new publication always feels like an Event with a capital \u201cE.\u201d Her legions of devoted fans won\u2019t need my recommendation to convince them to pick up her self-assured latest. But if you\u2019re a reader who loves playfully experimental fiction and haven\u2019t yet encountered Oyeyemi\u2019s oeuvre, might I suggest a trip to Prague by the pages of PARASOL AGAINST THE AXE? Prague becomes a character in the novel, as well as its setting and even a narrator. In the humorous opening section, the city is dismayed by encountering a WhatsApp group devoted to complaints about it. Oyeyemi, who has lived in Prague for a decade, is clearly having fun here, as the city composes a scathing response to the criticism: \u201cCOME ON KIDS, I wrote. Don\u2019t go to the city and then get all scandalized by city life. I\u2019m not even one of the grander metropolises! If I was I could have just eaten you and yours alive!\u201d \"Reading PARASOL AGAINST THE AXE can feel disorienting and is best enjoyed by a reader who can let go of any expectations and just succumb to its oddities. Oyeyemi is a storyteller like no other, and her latest masterpiece is an ode to the literal magic of story.\" Among those who travel to the city (whether or not they wind up leaving a complaint is an open question) is Hero Tojosoa, an author who has accepted a last-minute invitation to a bachelorette party for an old friend, Sofie Cibulkova. In between activities on a sweltering summer weekend, she picks up the \u201cPrague book\u201d her teenage son gave her to read on the trip, entitled Paradoxical Undressing, by an author named Merlin Mwenda. Readers are introduced to this fictional novel-within-a-novel, which on first reading is about a love triangle between a nobleman and two physicians. That in and of itself would not be that unusual, but the farther that readers travel into the pages of PARASOL AGAINST THE AXE, the more strange and unmoored Paradoxical Undressing, the characters and the city itself appear to be. Mwenda\u2019s novel is different depending on who\u2019s reading it and when. For example, on Hero\u2019s second opening of the book, the first chapter is entirely different. Even Mwenda\u2019s bio does not stay the same from one reading to the next. Things get even more bizarre when the narrative switches to the perspective of Dorothea Gilmartin, another party guest whose name happens to be the same as Hero\u2019s pen name (and she\u2019s not happy about it). Thea also picks up Paradoxical Undressing and --- surprise, surprise --- it\u2019s an entirely different story in her hands. Each of these nested stories is dense, compelling and fully realized. Oyeyemi has packed enough narrative for several novels into her relatively slim book. As the novel-within-a-novel proceeds, characters, situations and language start to spill out of Mwenda\u2019s pages and into the streets of contemporary Prague. Reading PARASOL AGAINST THE AXE can feel disorienting and is best enjoyed by a reader who can let go of any expectations and just succumb to its oddities. Oyeyemi is a storyteller like no other, and her latest masterpiece is an ode to the literal magic of story. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on March 9, 2024",

            "review": " Thirty-six-year-old Joy Okafor Bianchi feels in need of resuscitating her self-image, having taken the brunt of her family's criticism following her recent divorce. So despite having a demanding job as a mental health counselor, she takes it upon herself to coordinate an elaborate 70th birthday party for her mother, Mary, in a big rented house on the outskirts of Toronto. The entire extended clan is expected to be there, as well as family and friends of Nigerian origin who now live across North America. Joy is determined to show everyone that she's not only surviving, but also thriving post-divorce (even though she's not convinced of that herself most days). But just as the relatives start to arrive and the caterers are setting up, Joy's 12-year-old son, Jamil, reports back with a disturbing piece of news: he can't wake up his grandma from her nap. \"Hope and grief intermingle in these pages, which are also infused with the sights, sounds and tastes of a big Nigerian American gathering, full of food, traditions and stories.\" An investigation confirms that Mary Okafor has died in her sleep, and Joy, her siblings and her cousins confront how to transform a birthday party into a wake. Complicating matters considerably, the date is Good Friday. Having seen a brown cow on the side of the road on her way to the hospital, Mary's sister, Nancy --- a devout Christian --- declares this is a sign that Mary, like Jesus, will rise again on the third day. So the family, both believers and skeptics alike, settle in to sit vigil until Easter. Family reunions, regardless of the reason, tend to bring secrets and resentments to the surface, and this one is no exception. Almost all of the main characters have more going on than they'd like their relatives to know, and the more time they spend together, the harder secrets become to hide. Cousin Robert, whose family has never quite accepted his marriage to Paul, is reluctant to reveal his intentions to relocate to Ghana. Joy's older brother, Michael, won't explain why his wife, Shelly, is a no-show at the party. And Shelly and Michael's 18-year-old daughter, Sarah, is about to celebrate her six-month anniversary with her girlfriend but only feels safe sharing her feelings with her uncle Robert. Although Louisa Onom\u00e9 (who's making her adult debut here after writing three young adult novels) makes plenty of room for humor both broad and subtle, she also shows how Mary's death reopens old wounds, particularly Joy's persistent sadness about the death of her twin sister, Peace, 11 years earlier. This new loss has the potential to bring Joy and her brother closer together now that they are one another's closest relatives, or it could drive them farther apart. Hope and grief intermingle in these pages, which are also infused with the sights, sounds and tastes of a big Nigerian American gathering, full of food, traditions and stories. Readers will feel fortunate to have been invited to be part of this transformative reunion. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on April 6, 2024",

            "review": " For many years, readers of SHADES OF GREY have been holding out hope that there would be a sequel. The story of Eddie Russett and the bizarre world he inhabited needed to be revisited. And for years, Jasper Fforde promised that a further tale was in the offing. With the publication of RED SIDE STORY, that promise has been fulfilled. Eddie, our fearless narrator, is back, and he is about to be married to Violet deMauve. The rules here remain the same: the citizenry can only see one natural color with differences in saturation. Your place within society is defined by the shade you see. It factors into your job prospects, the depth (or shallowness) of your marriage pool, and even the class in which you will be permitted to exist. And, just for fun, everyone is affixed with a barcode. Did I mention the killer swans? \"Fforde\u2019s worldbuilding in RED SIDE STORY continues to be equal parts 1984 and something from the mind of the late, great Terry Pratchett.\" Never mind about that. RED SIDE STORY picks up in the aftermath of the events of the prior installment. Do you need to read that book? Well, yes. You should. However, Fforde does provide a pretty solid explanation of things early on if you want to fudge your way past it. But to be honest, you definitely should begin with SHADES OF GREY. As I was saying, Eddie is due to be married to Ms. deMauve, but nothing ever comes easy in this society. His life is about to be turned upside down by many factors, not the least of which is the reintroduction of Jane Grey, the woman he loved from the first book. Jane can see the color Green. Just a little, but enough. That places her on the opposite side of the color spectrum from Eddie, who sees Red. This makes their \u201cfriendship\u201d illegal in the eyes of the Colourtocracy. Rules in this world are enforced with great vigor. Mistakes, though sometimes made, are never corrected. Now Eddie is on trial for a murder he did not commit. And to make matters worse, he discovers that he is not Eddie Russett at all. Fforde\u2019s worldbuilding in RED SIDE STORY continues to be equal parts 1984 and something from the mind of the late, great Terry Pratchett. It is horrifying in the dystopia and the authoritarian way of such tales, yet the spin he puts on it is amusing and frequently laugh-out-loud funny. Oftentimes you can equate elements of our present world with the story and see the foundations, and sometimes he is a little too obvious and up front about it. Nothing, though, takes away from the great wit and fun to be had here. Reading it, you know you are embroiled in a fantastical Jasper Fforde tale. By the time you turn the final page, you will be sorrowful at its end. Here\u2019s to hoping a third installment is not a decade away.

            "review": " Not only is THE BLUES BROTHERS a comprehensive exploration of the fictional blues singers Jake and Elwood Blues, it\u2019s also a fascinating look at the careers of its portrayers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Daniel de Vis\u00e9 gives us so much to savor in this book, especially when it comes to his treatment of the late, great Belushi. It is sobering to see how everyone within his orbit during his meteoric rise knew that he was going to flame out shortly. But what a ride it was! The history is taken chronologically, which I love when we are dealing with such a lengthy period of time. However, the Prologue opens with the moment the world meets Jake and Elwood. It was on April 22, 1978, during the third season of \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The opening sketch started with Paul Shaffer doing his Don Kirschner impression as he introduced the two Ray-Ban sunglasses-wearing, black-suited brothers from Joliet, Illinois. At first, the audience didn\u2019t know what to make of it. Was it a comic bit or not? Their first song, \u201cHey Bartender,\u201d was backed by a professional-sounding band, and the boys brought it home. The Blues Brothers were born! \"THE BLUES BROTHERS is a pleasure to behold and is expertly researched by De Vis\u00e9. So step back in time to what many people consider a better, more innocent, fun-loving age and immerse yourself with the legends known as The Blues Brothers.\" John Belushi\u2019s quick wit and knack for improv comedy put him on the map and launched a career that began with the Second City troupe in Chicago. His time there even found him visiting the start-up branch in Toronto, which is where he met Dan Aykroyd. He then did his Joe Cocker impersonation for the off-Broadway show \u201cLemmings,\u201d which also starred Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest. He loved New York City and caught the eye of NBC producer Lorne Michaels, who was putting together a cast for a late-night sketch comedy show. His first hire was Gilda Radner, also an alumnus from Second City Toronto, followed by Belushi and (thanks to Belushi\u2019s recommendation) Aykroyd. Even though Aykroyd\u2019s journey was different coming from Canada, he and Belushi hit it off right away like kismet. Soon they found themselves in competition with Chase for the spotlight on \u201cSNL\u201d during an inaugural season where none of them thought there would be a second. Belushi hated doing the recurring Bees sketch, but it was suggested that he turn it into a rock number with a band of bee-costumed musicians as they performed \u201cI\u2019m a King Bee.\u201d It was a hit, and it got Belushi and Aykroyd thinking about the characters they had created on a lark: Jake and Elwood Blues. This brings us to the moment depicted in the Prologue when The Blue Brothers made their triumphant debut on \u201cSNL.\u201d It helped launch the careers of Belushi and Aykroyd in music and film, and eventually led to their departure from the show for Hollywood. Belushi already had found much success with Animal House and was signed on for the Steven Spielberg film 1941, where he also got Aykroyd and John Candy small roles. Although it bombed at the box office, Belushi and Aykroyd were inspired to write a script for a Blues Brothers movie. It took a long time to move from concept to screen, and the stories about the John Landis-directed film are legendary. The numerous cameos included Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, John Lee Hooker and Cab Calloway. The Blues Band was made up of some of the best musicians out there, including legendary blues/rock guitarists Steve Cropper and Duck Dunn. The movie was overblown, overlong and overbudget, and some screen tests said that it was too muddled and \u201ctoo black\u201d for a white audience. Belushi and Aykroyd scoffed at the criticism and stuck to their guns. Thirty minutes were trimmed from the director\u2019s cut, and The Blues Brothers became one of the highest grossing pictures of 1980. It is still considered a cult classic with some of the best music, comedy and stunts/car chases ever recorded on film. As much fun as this book is, it\u2019s like watching Titanic. You\u2019re enjoying it so much that you almost forget about the tragic ending. On March 5, 1982, John Belushi died from a drug overdose at the age of 33. Even with this morose bit that needs to be experienced to truly appreciate their legacy, THE BLUES BROTHERS is a pleasure to behold and is expertly researched by De Vis\u00e9. So step back in time to what many people consider a better, more innocent, fun-loving age and immerse yourself with the legends known as The Blues Brothers. Hit it!

            "review": " In the Preface to Eliza Barry Callahan's slim novel, THE HEARING TEST, the narrator comes across a synopsis of a movie that seems to encapsulate what she's been experiencing over the past year: \"The heroes of the film are almost thirty and very often at this time people have a period of revision of the positions already developed earlier. That it is sometimes associated with loss.\" In the case of the narrator, who remains unnamed for most of the book, that loss is a sudden loss of hearing, accompanied by a droning sound that she compares to \"a large piece of sheet metal being rocked, a perpetually rolling thunder.\" She is particularly attuned to sounds and silence. A composer of film scores, she finds that this development renders her not only disoriented but also unable to create new work. \"[The book] describ[es] a particular experience that most people might never undergo, but --- thanks in no small part to Callahan's vivid and introspective approach --- is possible to imagine.\" This baffling medical condition is diagnosed as \"bad luck,\" also known as \"Sudden Deafness.\" The specialists she sees differ in their opinions about whether or not it is likely to worsen and, if so, to what extent. But they all agree that there's nothing much that can be done beyond monitoring the situation. Clearly this could have become a crisis, but instead, the narrator uses her sudden loss of hearing as a jumping-off point for interrogation --- of her own stage of life, her relationship to sounds and silence, and the relationships of others (mostly other creative people) to these same phenomena. She also navigates online forums dedicated to others who share her condition, and she undertakes virtual visits with a hypnotherapist. Coincidentally, this sudden deafness first occurs in August 2019, meaning that the narrator's chronicle of her year overlaps with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. One could read her experience as a microcosm of the disorientation and isolation most people felt at this time. But the book is also singular in its focus, describing a particular experience that most people might never undergo, but --- thanks in no small part to Callahan's vivid and introspective approach --- is possible to imagine. Readers expecting some kind of linear illness-diagnosis-remedy plot would probably be better served elsewhere, but for those who enjoy surrendering to moods of quiet contemplation, THE HEARING TEST is a gift. It touches on many forms of art --- visual art, dance, music, literature --- and those who create it. It explores the ways in which relationships --- parental, romantic, sexual, platonic --- change according to time and circumstances. And it traces how sometimes not having all the answers can lead to journeys of greater understanding, by way of some surprising meanderings. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on March 29, 2024",

            "review": " On a remote island, what is left of Blackheath, a highly advanced lab, remains. And on that island lives Blackheath\u2019s former director and founding genius, Niema Mandripilias. Niema is one of the three island elders --- a benevolent yet enigmatic leader of the hundred-plus people who live in the village. At first blush, the island is a utopia. Everyone is happy and has exactly what they need. They are safe from the deadly fog that blankets the rest of the earth. That is, until Niema is murdered. Not just another post-apocalyptic survival tale, Stuart Turton\u2019s new novel, THE LAST MURDER AT THE END OF THE WORLD, is full of curiosity, power, creativity and a unique understanding of family. Turton creates not only a world built on the science that remains after a climate disaster, but also an entertaining locked-room mystery. Who is the killer in this society of peace and order? How does the murder set into motion further destruction yet also serve to save humanity? And what is humanity really? \"Not just another post-apocalyptic survival tale...THE LAST MURDER AT THE END OF THE WORLD is full of curiosity, power, creativity and a unique understanding of family.... Overall, this is a fun, clever and provocative story about the end of one world and the beginning of a better one.\" There is a large cast of characters here that is sometimes hard to keep track of, but the story most closely follows Emory, a mother who is somewhat estranged from her father and her daughter. She also has lost both her mother and her husband. In the rigid community into which Emory was born, she stands out as aimless yet critical. A deep thinker and fierce questioner, she never found her place in the limited set of occupations that the elders allow the villagers. While others are content to accept their lot, obey the elders and find joy in simple hobbies, Emory wants to understand the world. She has kept notebooks full of questions her entire life. Most of them are never answered and annoy or frustrate those around her. But to solve a series of crimes and save the inhabitants of the fog-surrounded island, Emory\u2019s skills of observation, puzzle solving and questioning are finally seen as valuable. Emory and her daughter, Clara, are granted greater access to the history, memories and foundations of the island by Abi, the omniscient voice in the minds of all who live there. Abi is the narrator of the novel but holds information back from readers, just as she does from Emory, as she sets out to find the culprit and reveal his or her motive. The catch is, if the killer isn\u2019t brought to justice in just a few days, the fog will envelop the island and finally destroy humanity. At the heart of THE LAST MURDER AT THE END OF THE WORLD is an exploration of humanity itself, especially as it is expressed through family. When Emory and Clara work together, they begin to heal generations of sadness, loss, distrust and misunderstanding. All the while, Clara and her grandfather, Seth, begin to think more like Emory, wondering who they are, what the world really is, and what both humanity and technology are capable of in the face of catastrophe. Turton packs a lot of detail into this novel along with some cool, but not always surprising, reveals. The original disaster (sinkholes, fog, insects, societal chaos) is not explained in much depth. Instead he spends about a third of the book bringing readers into the life of the island before the real action of the mystery begins. Peering too closely at the details is to miss the overarching and thoughtful themes and ideas here. Overall, this is a fun, clever and provocative story about the end of one world and the beginning of a better one. Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman on May 25, 2024",

            "review": " The most thrilling work yet from the bestselling, prize-winning author of THE NEWLYWEDS and LOST AND WANTED, a stunning new novel set in French Polynesia and New York City about three characters who undergo massive transformations over the course of a single year. From Mo\u2019orea, a tiny volcanic island off the coast of Tahiti, a French biologist obsessed with saving Polynesia\u2019s imperiled coral reefs sends her teenage daughter to live with her ex-husband in New York. By the time 15-year-old Pia arrives at her father Stephen\u2019s luxury apartment in Manhattan and meets his new, younger wife, Kate, she has been shuttled between her parents\u2019 disparate lives --- her father\u2019s consuming work as a surgeon at an overwhelmed New York hospital, her mother\u2019s relentless drive against a ticking ecological clock --- for most of her life. Fluent in French, intellectually precocious, moving between cultures with seeming ease, Pia arrives in New York poised for a rebellion, just as COVID sends her and her stepmother together into near total isolation. A New York City schoolteacher, Kate struggles to connect with a teenager whose capacity for destruction seems exceeded only by her privilege. Even as Kate fails to parent Pia --- and questions her own ability to become a mother --- one of her 16-year-old students is already caring for a toddler full time. Athyna\u2019s love for her nephew, Marcus, is a burden that becomes heavier as she struggles to finish her senior year online. Juggling her manifold responsibilities, Athyna finds herself more and more anxious every time she leaves the house. Just as her fear of what is waiting for her outside her Staten Island community feels insupportable, an incident at home makes her desperate to leave. When their lives collide, Pia and Athyna spiral toward parallel but inescapably different tragedies. Moving from a South Pacific \u201cparadise,\u201d where rage still simmers against the colonial government and its devastating nuclear tests, to the extreme inequalities of 21st-century New York City, THE LIMITS is an unforgettably moving novel about nation, race, class and family. Heart-wrenching and humane, a profound work from one of America\u2019s most prodigiously gifted novelists.",

            "review": " In imagining the near future, it is easy to get bogged down in the details. Political upheavals and climate disasters forcing global migrations, technical failures, scarcity and extinctions are just a few of the not-so-fantastical areas explored in dystopian and speculative fiction. T\u00e9a Obreht imagines all of these in her latest novel, THE MORNINGSIDE. Cities have emptied, coastlines have flooded, political turmoil has created refugees hoping to find security, economies have faltered, and educational institutions have broken down. Yet, while all of this looms large and brings Obreht\u2019s characters together in a very specific place, this is a human story. The book focuses on the characters themselves, leaving readers to fill in the gaps of context in order to understand this altered world. \"THE MORNINGSIDE...is a compelling story of survival and family.... [Obreht's] storytelling is engrossing and humane. The result is another successful outing from one of our most interesting authors.\" Eleven-year-old Silvia has just arrived at Island City as part of a transnational Repopulation Program aimed at settling political and climate refugees into all but abandoned urban areas. Silvia and her mother will be living at the storied Morningside building, with Silvia\u2019s great aunt Ena, who is the superintendent of the property. The building rests in a once-bustling city whose concerns are broadcast by the Dispatcher, a knowledgeable and kindly pirate radio host. Silvia\u2019s mother, a tough and hard-working woman, has not revealed much to Silvia about the country they come from (referred to by the characters as Back Home), Silvia\u2019s paternity or their culture, yet Silvia acts as her mother\u2019s constant translator and social guide. Aunt Ena, on the other hand, is excited to tell Silvia about her family and their lives Back Home, including stories of Silvia\u2019s early years. These tales fuel Silvia\u2019s imagination and strengthen her belief in the folk magic (protection spells in particular) that she learned from Signora Tesseretti back in their previous home of Paraiso. Relative to Silvia\u2019s slightly fantastical view of the world is her interest in the enigmatic resident of the building\u2019s penthouse, Bezi Duras. When Ena dies, things begin to unravel at The Morningside. This includes a tenuous friendship with Mila Belen, a bold girl who has moved into the building, and a writer named May, who no longer lives there. The fragile safety that Silvia\u2019s mother has created for her daughter is fractured as Silvia and Mila stalk Bezi Duras across the desolate city in the night following a terrifying accident, and then when Silvia\u2019s mother recognizes Mila\u2019s father from Back Home. A final tragedy both solidifies Silvia\u2019s belief in magic and forces her to confront the harsh realities of the world she inhabits. All the while, the Morningside --- with its quiet, elusive and powerful residents --- symbolizes a world in the midst of transformation. From a war-torn Eastern Europe to a New York City underwater, THE MORNINGSIDE --- threaded with superstitions and enchantments --- is a compelling story of survival and family. Silvia navigates an almost devastated world with curiosity, resilience and optimism.\u00a0Even in this bleak future, the emotions, responses and relationships are familiar and transcend time and place. Obreht\u2019s plot is a bit clumsy at times, but her storytelling is engrossing and humane. The result is another successful outing from one of our most interesting authors.

            "review": " Bettina Blazak, a well-known reporter for The Coastal Eddy, has a nose for stories that sell. And that\u2019s just what takes her to a veterinary clinic in Tijuana. But while she goes down to Mexico for a story, she comes back with much more. As Dr. Felix Rodriguez shows Bettina around the clinic, they come to a dog she wants to hear more about (named \u201cshot dog\u201d by the vet). He says that a young boy brought him in, bleeding and suffering from grave injuries. He labored to save the animal, giving him a second chance. Almost without thinking, Bettina adopts the dog. Of course, she knows nothing about him or how he got hurt; she just can\u2019t let him die after all that she has heard. The dog\u2019s 30-day adoption period expires that very day. He can no longer be kept at the clinic, and he can't be released onto the streets. That leaves just one option. \"[I]t\u2019s easy to sympathize with Bettina while immersed in THE RESCUE. Figuring out how she can solve her problem, though? Well, it\u2019s a good thing that T. Jefferson Parker is there to come up with the solution.\" Back at her Laguna Beach home, Bettina names her new friend Felix, after the vet who saved his life. She knows her Coastal Eddy readers will go wild over the story of the clinic and the dog. And she\u2019s right; they do. The article\u2019s success spurs her to seek out the boy who brought the dog to the clinic so she can do another feature about Felix and his escape from danger. But he's far from out of danger. As Bettina digs deeper into what happened the night Felix got shot, she comes to realize the connection between her beloved new dog and the Mexican drug cartels. Recently, people have begun to contact Bettina for reasons other than praising her wonderful stories. They say that Felix --- whose real name is Joe --- rightfully belongs to them. And they want him back. A teenager claims that he owned Joe years ago, before he became a DEA drug-sniffing dog. A man named Dan Strickland tells her that Joe is his and once assisted in his self-defense academy. Plus, the Sinaloans want Joe because he has cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in stolen or confiscated drugs. Bettina refuses all of their requests, no matter the amount of money offered. Felix --- that\u2019s his name, not Joe --- is her dog. She loves and adores him and will not give him up. Bettina is a woman with more backbone than your average 28-year-old. She loves high-octane sports, knows how to handle a gun, and doesn\u2019t want to rely on anyone but herself for protection. But when you have ruthless, powerful people like drug cartels hunting you down, backbone may not be enough. Who do you trust, though? Bettina believes that Strickland might be okay, but she's not fully confident. She also has a local cop who wants to help, some DEA agents...and, of course, her trusty dog. They all profess to be watching out for her. Still, she has gotten herself in the middle of a fine mess. Getting out of it is going to take more than just a little cleverness, some chutzpah and a lot of finesse, even with the cops and the DEA involved. Who among us wouldn\u2019t put up a huge fight for our pet? We love them like family, right? So it\u2019s easy to sympathize with Bettina while immersed in THE RESCUE. Figuring out how she can solve her problem, though? Well, it\u2019s a good thing that T. Jefferson Parker is there to come up with the solution. Things look pretty grim for both Felix and Bettina, but Parker finds a miraculous way out. Bravo! Reviewed by Kate Ayers on April 28, 2023",

THE WHITE BOOK becomes a meditation on the color white, as well as a fictional journey inspired by an older sister who died in her mother's arms, a few hours old. The narrator grapples with the tragedy that has haunted her family, an event she colors in stark white --- breast milk, swaddling bands, the baby's rice cake-colored skin --- and, from here, visits all that glows in her memory: from a white dog to sugar cubes. As the writer reckons with the enormity of her sister's death, Han Kang's trademark frank and chilling prose is softened by retrospection, introspection, and a deep sense of resilience and love. THE WHITE BOOK --- ultimately a letter from Kang to her sister --- offers powerful philosophy and personal psychology on the tenacity and fragility of the human spirit, and our attempts to graft new life from the ashes of destruction.",

But her quest --- spanning from Paris to New York\u2019s Harlem, to Havana and Key West --- is complicated by the fact that she believes him to be famed luminary Ernest Hemingway, a man just as elusive as he is iconic. She desperately yearns for his approval, as both a daughter and a writer, convinced that he holds the key to who she's truly meant to be. But what will happen if she's wrong, or if her real story falls outside of the legend of her parentage that she\u2019s revered all her life? THE WILDEST SUN is a dazzling, unexpected and transportive story about coming into adulthood --- from escaping our pasts, to the stories we tell ourselves, to the ambition that drives us --- as we seek to find out who we are.",

            "review": " Let\u2019s be honest: Not everyone loves baseball. The powers that be instituted new rules this year to address one of the major complaints --- that the games take too long. Chalk it up to a decreased attention span or an increased interest in other activities. Those who do love the national pastime do so for a number of reasons, not the least of which is an appreciation of history featuring names like Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Mickey Mantle, Sandy Koufax, and many more stars who were covered in Joe Posnanski\u2019s previous gem, THE BASEBALL 100. \"I doubt that many will argue with Posnanski\u2019s #1 moment, but a few eyebrows undoubtedly will be raised and heads scratched.\" For his latest instant classic, WHY WE LOVE BASEBALL, Posnanski has selected 50 iconic moments (actually more than a hundred in various forms) as justification for baseball\u2019s enduring popularity. As with THE BASEBALL 100, these moments are offered not as a definitive answer, but as a conversation starter. What puts \u201cA\u201d in a higher position than \u201cB\u201d? How do you weigh them all? It\u2019s worth noting that Posnanski never claims that his choices in either book are the \u201cbest\u201d or the \u201cgreatest.\u201d THE BASEBALL 100 doesn\u2019t even have a subtitle, leaving readers to draw their own conclusions. Some are important (the ones that are actually \u201cranked\u201d), while others are more frivolous. Is a ball hitting an outfielder on the head and bouncing over the wall for a home run as important as a dramatic pennant-winning homer? Of course not. Some moments are not even real. In the chapter \u201cFive Funny Things,\u201d Posnanski mentions A League of Their Own and a classic Bugs Bunny cartoon. Of course, the tension builds as we count down to the final 10. A lot of people will be tempted to jump ahead. Don\u2019t. That way lies madness. I doubt that many will argue with Posnanski\u2019s #1 moment, but a few eyebrows undoubtedly will be raised and heads scratched.

New York Times bestselling author Stephanie Dray returns with a captivating and dramatic new novel about American heroine Frances Perkins. Raised on tales of her revolutionary ancestors, Frances Perkins arrives in New York City at the turn of the century, armed with her trusty parasol and an unyielding determination to make a difference. When she\u2019s not working with children in the crowded tenements in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Frances throws herself into the social scene in Greenwich Village, befriending an eclectic group of politicians, artists and activists, including the millionaire socialite Mary Harriman Rumsey, the flirtatious budding author Sinclair Lewis, and the brilliant but troubled reformer Paul Wilson, with whom she falls deeply in love. But when Frances meets a young lawyer named Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a tea dance, sparks fly in all the wrong directions. She thinks he\u2019s a rich, arrogant dilettante who gets by on a handsome face and a famous name. He thinks she\u2019s a priggish bluestocking and insufferable do-gooder. Neither knows it yet, but over the next 20 years, they will form a historic partnership that will carry them both to the White House. Frances is destined to rise in a political world dominated by men, facing down the Great Depression as FDR\u2019s most trusted lieutenant --- even as she struggles to balance the demands of a public career with marriage and motherhood. And when vicious political attacks mount and personal tragedies threaten to derail her ambitions, she must decide what she\u2019s willing to do --- and what she\u2019s willing to sacrifice --- to save a nation.",

            "review": " Most readers associate John Grisham with courtroom novels. Some of his best-known works have involved deep dives into the world of noble attorneys and the American justice system with all its flaws. But Grisham is not content to simply turn out legal-themed stories on a regular basis. His success allows him substantial latitude in the books he writes and the subjects he covers. In 2017\u2019s CAMINO ISLAND, Grisham introduced readers to the eponymous fictional island off the coast of Florida. In the small resort town of Santa Rosa, we met Bruce Cable, the owner of an independent bookstore and a dealer in rare books, and Mercer Mann, an author struggling to complete a second novel following the success of her debut. Three years later, Grisham gave us a follow-up, CAMINO WINDS, and now we can celebrate his third Camino release. \"CAMINO GHOSTS is a joyful adventure. The characters are well-known to Grisham fans, and the story will keep you turning the pages until the conclusion.\" CAMINO GHOSTS begins on the beach at Camino Island, where Mercer and Thomas celebrate their wedding with close friends. Mercer, who is an important character in the series, is also a creative writing teacher at the University of Mississippi. In addition to allowing Grisham to promote his alma mater, Mercer\u2019s work as a novelist affords him the opportunity to enlighten readers on how the publishing industry operates. Mercer is planning to write and publish a book based on the lives of a group of Black Africans transported to America as slaves. Their travel to the South is interrupted by storms, and they end up on a small barrier island off the Florida coast known as Dark Isle. There they live secretly for centuries as free individuals until new storms eventually make it uninhabitable. Bruce hopes that Mercer can turn these events into a book. For the story to be told, Mercer must work with Lovely Jackson, an 80-year-old Black woman who is the last surviving heir of Dark Isle. It will not be an easy task. The history of Dark Isle is mysterious. No one has populated it for centuries, and legends abound as to why. Many are convinced that the area is cursed, and that belief is encouraged when a land developer emerges with plans to build residences, a golf course and a casino on the island. But the situation become a little dicey when those sent to begin the development meet with death. To add to the mystery, there is one more Grisham ingredient for a great story: a lawsuit over who actually owns Dark Isle. It's a typical Grisham novel. The bad guys have big plans, while the good guys hope to stop them. Along the way, Grisham shows his talent for poking fun at the foibles of publishing, as well as the legal system. It\u2019s a gentle poking since both of these enterprises have provided him with a permanent and deserved position on bestseller lists. CAMINO GHOSTS is a joyful adventure. The characters are well-known to Grisham fans, and the story will keep you turning the pages until the conclusion. It\u2019s a great summer read from a gifted writer.

            "review": " You have heard of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. You probably have read their works of Transcendentalism, either as a school assignment or to explore their ideas about self, insight and nature. But have you read about or even heard of Margaret Fuller? Fuller was the author of several books in the mid-19th century and worked as a journalist, editor and book reviewer in New England, New York and Europe. She is said to be an inspiration for Hester Prynne and some of Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry, and she spoke out strongly in favor of more rights for women, African Americans and inmates. She was a trailblazer and a controversial figure, and she died tragically when she was just 40 years old. In bestselling author Allison Pataki\u2019s latest novel, FINDING MARGARET FULLER, readers are gifted with a first-person narrative of Fuller\u2019s fascinating life. \"[T]he prose here is deft and the story sweeping. Overall, FINDING MARGARET FULLER is a lovely tribute to a remarkable and unfortunately all-but-forgotten American giant.\" In the summer of 1836, Margaret Fuller makes her way to Concord, Massachusetts. She is the guest of the great Ralph Waldo Emerson at his home, which was called Bush. Fuller caught Emerson\u2019s attention when she wrote a tribute to his brother, Charles, who died of tuberculosis. Soon after her arrival, it becomes clear to Fuller that Emerson surrounds himself with brilliant writers and unconventional thinkers, and she is thrilled to be part of the group that will come to be known as the Transcendentalists. Thoreau works in Emerson\u2019s gardens, and the Alcotts, including a very young Louisa May, are neighbors. Over the years, Bush comes to be Fuller\u2019s home away from home. There she writes and walks with the men as they ponder the role of spirituality, the meaning of truth and the importance of self-reliance. Away from Bush, she works as a writer, tutor, teacher and translator, moving from city to city and sending money home to help support her mother. As ideal as her time at Bush often is, it also can be challenging there, just as her professional life is. Emerson\u2019s wife, Lidian, understandably is not always happy to see Fuller return, and her time in Concord tends to remind her that she is single and childless ---- which is quite shocking for the day, not to mention lonely. When Horace Greeley sends her to Europe, she finds solace and contentment --- along with romance --- in Italy. In Rome, she meets Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and his lover, the infamous George Sand, as well as the dashing young Giovanni Ossoli. Readers know from the prologue the terrible fate that Fuller meets, and Pataki foreshadows it through her nightmares and fears. Margaret Fuller\u2019s life was one of deep learning, hard work and adventure. The effort that she must have put into all of this is not always apparent in Pataki\u2019s telling, where opportunities seem to come her way and her strivings and exertions are not always made explicit. The pace can be slow, more like Fuller\u2019s walks around Walden Pond than her time agitating for the Roman Republic and then fleeing Rome for her safety. Still, the prose here is deft and the story sweeping. Overall, FINDING MARGARET FULLER is a lovely tribute to a remarkable and unfortunately all-but-forgotten American giant.

            "review": " Most of us who have dogs or cats know that animals play a lot. They do it with us, with other animals, or on their own. In KINGDOM OF PLAY, David Toomey explores how a multitude of animals play in nature. This is not a light read, but rather a book that goes deep into the science of play, even the neuroscience and culture of play. But even Toomey points out that sometimes we just don't know why animals play. Cats, for example, play with their food if it's of the live variety. They are known for playing with mice before killing them. Why? Toomey explains: \"Sarah L. Hall of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Southampton summarized the conclusions of similar studies, writing, 'It is unclear why cats play with live prey.'\" He points out that we've seen cats play with their prey for as long as we have been in existence, but we still don't know why they do it. \"...detailed and fascinating... [T]he information about animals and play generally will delight readers and animal lovers.\" Those of us on social media might have seen videos of dogs sliding down snow-covered hills over and over again, obviously playing just as much as any child might sled down that same hill. Toomey does not shy away from including information about dogs, including a hypothesis about how wolves were first induced to become our companions. He mentions that in \"a surprisingly short time --- only forty or so generations --- the wolves' appearance changed, with more and more having splotchy coats, floppy ears, and wagging tails.\" The reference for the above quote is Brian Hare, who wrote THE GENIUS OF DOGS. In that book, the chapter titled \"Clever as a Fox\" details a Russian experiment whereby within 40 generations, Siberian foxes bred by selecting those more amenable to humans began to change physically as well. In addition to being friendly, they wagged their tails and had floppy ears and splotchy coats. It's a fascinating study, and perhaps an insight into how the wolf eventually became the dog. The play bow is what dogs do when they want another dog to play with them. Dogs love to play and run around. If they don't have anyone to play with, they often will throw things in the air, run like crazy around a space, and dig with abandon. Dogs know how to have a good time. But so do many other species. In this detailed and fascinating book, we learn that octopuses will take objects in their tank and play with them, blowing them into a vent that then pushes the objects back at them. Even fish play, as Toomey details how captive sturgeon were seen swimming to the top of the water, gulping air, and releasing the bubbles from the bottom of the tank. Other fish were observed spitting eggs from one to the other, back and forth. Were they playing ball? Toomey shares how each animal plays and the place and time from which that behavior might have evolved. We go on scientific journeys back up the evolutionary ladder as we read all about play in nature. While there might be more science in the book than some would like, the information about animals and play generally will delight readers and animal lovers.

            "review": " LUCKY is a novel about folk singer Jodie Rattler, told in her own voice. Born in 1949, Jodie comes of age with \u201cthe four J's\u201d --- Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, Judy Collins and Janis Joplin. Growing up in St. Louis, she becomes a connoisseur of its streets and neighborhoods (Skinker, Webster, Kirkwood), homes (shacks next to brick mansions) and the overall kaleidoscopic vibe of her city. She lives with her single mother but counts on a loving extended family, particularly her uncle Drew. It\u2019s Drew who takes her to the horse races when she\u2019s six years old and has her circle some numbers on a piece of paper. When that horse comes in against heavy odds, he keeps $5,900 in winnings but gives her a pile of bills. \u201cIt was forty-three two-dollar bills, the $86 that I later realized would tell everyone where he had been and how he had gotten the money.\u201d Jodie never tells anyone, and she never spends it; it\u2019s her lucky talisman. \"Towards the end of the novel, Jane Smiley pulls a Jane Smiley on us. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say, because I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise.\" Jodie grows into a thoughtful, observant and careful young person, who never feels like she fits in at school. But her life is full of music, and people of a certain age (ahem) will recognize the titles of the 45s her mother plays on their record player and the tunes the family sings at her grandparents\u2019 piano after Sunday dinner, including \u201cOh Shenandoah\u201d and \u201cRed River Valley.\u201d Jodie\u2019s mother herself had dreams of being a star in New York City, but becoming pregnant (by a married man) with Jodie sent her back to St. Louis. So Jodie comes by her voice and talent honestly, and she sets out to develop it. She learns to stick her jaw out to give herself a deeper vibrato. Her older cousin, Brucie, plays guitar, and as a teenager she\u2019s singing along with his band, the Big Muddies. Drew, who is making quite a bit of money investing, takes her to father-daughter days at school. And when the time comes, he accompanies her on a college tour. At Penn State, Jodie feels prepared for all her classes except music theory, which is about the history of music (Bach and Beethoven), not music itself. \u201cThe main thing I learned was that I wasn\u2019t a child prodigy but that I was lucky to have grown up in a family that loved music.\u201d She also was lucky to land gigs in traveling bands during college summers, to write and sing songs alone and with others. Jodie recounts in a matter-of-fact way her early success making a couple of albums. She has lovers, but there\u2019s little real boyfriend drama, until she moves to England after college because she\u2019d liked what she\u2019d seen on a brief tour there. Her true passion is writing and singing songs. We learn the sometimes prosaic events that inspire her and read the lyrics that come out of it. She\u2019s quite content to travel out of a backpack and let Drew\u2019s investments of her earnings grow to a point where she doesn\u2019t have to worry about money. I found Jodie fascinating. She narrates her life in a precise but somewhat distant way and doesn\u2019t lose any sleep comparing herself to anybody. If she\u2019s ambitious, her ambitions are to see the world and make music (and love) on her own terms. \u201cAs for me, I thought it was politically correct for me to sleep around, because I was a feminist, and I thought the essence of feminism was to claim the same rights and privileges that men had, and always had had.\u201d She achieves all of this but ultimately ends up back in St. Louis, caring for family and cherishing that city --- always noticing, always practicing, always writing songs. She figures out that she needs to learn to make friends, and she watches others to see how they do it: a smile, a chat, a friendly touch. She even makes connections with some of her high school classmates. Towards the end of the novel, Jane Smiley pulls a Jane Smiley on us. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say, because I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise. Especially if you\u2019re a fan, it\u2019s a bonus. But even if you\u2019re not, you\u2019re in for a treat.

In the early 1980s, Giselle Chin, Jackie Ong and Ellen Ng are three teenagers drawn together by their shared sense of alienation and desire for something different. \u201cAllied in the weirdest parts of themselves,\u201d they envision each other as artistic collaborators and embark on a future defined by freedom and creativity. By the time they are adults, their dreams are murkier. As a performance artist, Giselle must navigate an elite social world she never conceived of. As a coder thrilled by the internet\u2019s early egalitarian promise, Jackie must contend with its more sinister shift toward monetization and surveillance. And as a community activist, Ellen confronts the increasing gentrification and policing overwhelming her New York City neighborhood. Over time their friendship matures and changes, their definitions of success become complicated, and their sense of what matters evolves. Moving from the predigital 1980s to the art and tech subcultures of the 1990s to a strikingly imagined portrait of the 2040s, MEMORY PIECE is an innovative and audacious story of three lifelong friends as they strive to build satisfying lives in a world that turns out to be radically different from the one they were promised.",

            "review": " It's a bit of a daunting prospect to embark on reviewing Lauren Oyler's collection of essays, NO JUDGMENT. For one thing, as the title suggests (more on that later), her book --- following her debut novel, FAKE ACCOUNTS --- explores, in large part, the very project of contemporary literary criticism. For another, now that I've read her essay \"My Perfect Opinions\" included in the volume, I know for a fact that she reads reviews of her work. And she's judging those as well. \"Those who enjoy [Oyler's] self-confidently ironic tone and unapologetic approach to criticism will find much to delight in here.\" Oyler, who is at least as well known for her series of devastating takedowns of other critics and creatives as she is for her fiction, takes the idea of \"judgment\" as her jumping-off point. As she points out, the phrase \"no judgment\" implies anything but, and Oyler has no shortage of opinions on everything from Todd Field's 2022 film, T\u00e1r (\"I hate books and films that aren't realistic, that don't reflect the nuances of the real world, which I believe to be truly infinitely fascinating\"), to TED talks (\"It seems impossible that I'd never watched one\") to popular culture like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (\"the emotional experience they produce is so intense that it distracts from stilted dialogue, bizarre plotting, a clich\u00e9d message.\") And, don't forget, theater (\"I hate theater, but I try to go anyway\"). In case you haven't picked up on it by now, Oyler seems fond of the one-line pronouncement, a format that might work exceedingly well on social media but eventually can start to grow tiresome in the context of a book-length collection of six essays. Throughout, Oyler clearly feels compelled to distinguish herself from other, less discerning consumers of culture. This contrast is drawn in especially high relief in \"My Perfect Opinions,\" in which she bemoans the outsized influence that Goodreads reviewers have not only on other readers' preferences, but also on the very trajectory of the publishing industry. And it's true that she's clearly smart, savvy and in tune with contemporary debates about, for example, the definition and purpose of autofiction. In what seems to be a barely cloaked takedown of its own, she thanks her editor for cutting a 2,500-word footnote about autofiction from FAKE ACCOUNTS so that she could, in turn, expand it into the essay that appears as \"I Am the One Who Is Sitting Here, for Hours and Hours and Hours\" in NO JUDGMENT. But readers who are drawn to the essay form because it conveys a search for meaning, an attempt to trace unusual and surprising connections, or even a fundamental curiosity about the world might find themselves coming away from these essays a bit cold or, at the very least, lukewarm. They tend toward the discursive, to the point that some readers might reach the end of a piece, perhaps having chuckled a time or two, perhaps having underlined one or more of those cutting one-liners, but still scratching their heads somewhat about what the essay as a whole was driving at. However, it's fair to say that few readers are going to walk away from NO JUDGMENT without at least forming strong opinions of their own about Oyler's style. Those who enjoy her self-confidently ironic tone and unapologetic approach to criticism will find much to delight in here. And the rest? Well, there's always Goodreads.
