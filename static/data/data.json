            "review": " Nickolas Butler, the critically acclaimed author of SHOTGUN LOVESONGS, returns with A FORTY YEAR KISS, a beautiful, life-affirming novel about second chances and sunset triumph. Featuring a sixty-something couple giving love another try as they revisit their youth, the book will appeal to any reader in need of a love story for the ages. When we meet Charlie, he is 64 years old and nursing a beer in a bar as he waits for his date to arrive. It\u2019s not exactly the future he had planned. Married at 20 and two more times since then, Charlie never expected to be having butterflies as he waits for a love match to find him. But even more surprising than being single at 60 is the identity of his date: his ex-wife, Vivian. Married for four years in their early 20s, Charlie and Vivian divorced for a number of reasons, but they all come back to one: Charlie\u2019s drinking, a bad habit with which he continues to struggle. But unlike the Charlie of 40 years ago, this Charlie at least knows he has a problem. He\u2019s determined to bury it once and for all so that he can love Vivian the way he was meant to: totally, completely and endlessly. It\u2019s a real \u201cwish upon a star\u201d kind of dream, but he is ready to do whatever it takes to earn her trust again, even if it means laying all of his cards on the table. \"This truly is a literary valentine that will appeal to readers from all walks of life and ages.... Perfect for book clubs, A FORTY YEAR KISS is dazzling in its lyricism and poignant in its takeaways.\" Of course, 40 years isn\u2019t a small amount of time, and while Charlie has been busy getting married and divorced and nursing his heartbreaks with alcohol, Vivian also has moved on. Married only one more time after Charlie, Vivian is now the single mother of Jessie and Melissa, and grandmother to Melissa\u2019s two girls, Ainsley and Addison. Jessie lives in a group home, so Vivian resides with Melissa and her daughters, fully immersing herself in all the pleasures and delights of grandmotherhood. Looking back, Vivian wouldn\u2019t change the trajectory of her life for anything --- not when she has two beloved, adorable granddaughters to show for it --- but even she can admit that she hasn\u2019t always been happy and her current life can sometimes feel a bit smothering. Simply put, it has been a long time since anyone really treasured her or was simply nice to her. So when she receives a message from her ex-husband, she doesn\u2019t think twice. What\u2019s wrong with grabbing a drink with an old friend? Charlie is quick to admit the real reason he returned to their small town after a near lifetime of working on trains: he is in love with Vivian and wants them to try to make it work again. Vivian is touched, even flattered by Charlie\u2019s zeal, and she can\u2019t deny that he certainly seems different: more focused and responsible, and less reactionary. But she also can\u2019t ignore the fact that she\u2019s grown very accustomed to her independence. Where she once cowered from her husband\u2019s outbursts, she is now much more comfortable having outbursts of her own, standing up for herself, and maintaining the boundaries she so carefully has built up after a lifetime of hurt. Rather than being turned off by this new, more confident Vivian, Charlie is entranced. This, he thinks, is the Vivian he always loved, the one he knew was hiding behind her unflappable exterior as he drank their life and love story away. With Charlie and Vivian committed to at least trying again, a few painful truths come to the forefront. First, Vivian has been hiding a secret from Charlie for 40 years, one that not only could threaten their reunion, but could change his life forever. Second, falling in love and agreeing to marry when you\u2019re young is one thing --- naivety comes with blinders, after all --- but doing the same thing at 60 is unbelievable, radical even. Both are set in their ways and routines, and blending their lives --- and those of Vivian\u2019s daughters and granddaughters --- comes with much higher stakes than it did when they were just two dumb kids in love. Add to that Charlie\u2019s alcoholism, and you have not just a love story, but a love battle, the ultimate fight for true love in all its iterations. With Charlie and Vivian confronting their pasts --- both shared and individual --- it will take many painful discussions, a lot of uncomfortable truths, and some serious reckoning with redemption for them to usher in and revive their love. Fortunately, with Nickolas Butler at the writing helm, A FORTY YEAR KISS does just that. This truly is a literary valentine that will appeal to readers from all walks of life and ages. Although it\u2019s a tender and compassionate tale, Butler is never overly sentimental or mawkish, choosing instead to let his characters\u2019 burdens and backstories ground the otherwise romantic plot and give it some real literary heft and muscle. Far from diluting the love story, this choice actually helps the romance between Charlie and Vivian come to life, almost turning it into a third character, the underdog you really root for. Although Charlie and Vivian are the stars of this tale, I was equally if not more charmed by Melissa and her interactions with Charlie. Despite the fact that Charlie has never fathered children or created a real family, his ability to adapt to and even rescue Vivian\u2019s daughter from herself is proof of his total redemption. It makes Vivian\u2019s love for him --- despite his flaws --- gritty and real, but also soaring and romantic. Perfect for book clubs, A FORTY YEAR KISS is dazzling in its lyricism and poignant in its takeaways. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on February 7, 2025",

            "review": " Not too long ago, Kate Alice Marshall made the transition from YA to adult fiction and has not looked back. Her latest release, A KILLING COLD, brings more of what her readers have come to expect in the form of psychological thrills full of plot twists. Assistant bookstore manager Theodora Scott was over the moon when she met Connor Dalton through a mutual friend six months ago. However, her fears will be put to the test when he suggests taking her to Idlewood, his family\u2019s isolated winter retreat in the snowy mountains. It\u2019s not that Theo is concerned about not living up to the Daltons\u2019 expectations; she\u2019s worried that they\u2019ll find out who she really is. \"If this starts to feel like an Agatha Christie mystery, you would not be too far off the mark. A KILLING COLD will keep your head spinning and mind guessing right through to the final act.\" Theo never told Connor that she did not know her birth parents and that her adoptive parents basically tuned her out after accusing her of being the devil\u2019s spawn. This certainly is not the best family background to make a first impression! Even though the reader is aware of this information early on in the novel, it never takes away from the suspense as nearly all of the characters seem to have something to hide and secrets they will fight valiantly to keep private. To make matters worse, Theo started receiving texts from an anonymous sender a few weeks prior to this trip with messages like \u201cStay away from Connor Dalton.\u201d It is interesting to see Theo waver between keeping her own secrets from being unearthed and trying to dig into the Dalton family to find out why someone is trying to scare her away from them. It becomes rather obvious that something is going on when the first person they meet at Idlewood, Connor\u2019s older sister, Lexie, pries him away for a private chat. The only piece of advice that Connor gave Theo was to win over their matriarch, Grandma Louise, and everyone else would follow suit. She is indeed a tough cookie, and Theo can\u2019t help but feel judged by each member of the family and household staff she meets. There is also another secret that Theo has kept to herself --- the nightmare she has had for decades involving weird symbolism and a man with antlers. She gets a chill up her spine when she finds a photo of Connor\u2019s late father holding a small girl. That child is Theo before she was adopted and began her new life. From this point on, all bets are off. Theo realizes that the looks she has received may have involved a bit of recognition of her true identity and how it might tie into their patriarch. Even Connor proves to be somewhat different from what Theo believed him to be, and that\u2019s when the claustrophobic feeling of cold isolation really begins to set in. Theo needs to remove herself from this place and situation but is unable to do so as everyone is snowed in. If this starts to feel like an Agatha Christie mystery, you would not be too far off the mark. A KILLING COLD will keep your head spinning and mind guessing right through to the final act.

            "review": " A LONG TIME GONE is perhaps the most personal story in Joshua Moehling\u2019s series starring Deputy Ben Packard, who already made a splash as an openly gay lead character. This time, it is not his sexuality that takes center stage, but his family\u2019s haunted past. After losing the local sheriff\u2019s race, Packard is dealing with the harsh reality that he now has to report to his hated rival as he is demoted to the position of bag check scanner at the courthouse. Trouble always seems to find Packard, and his latest stint is no exception. He is on duty when one of the parties in a heated case presents a weapon, and he is forced to fire, killing Robert Clark before he can get off a third shot. Now on administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated, Packard is thrust back into his past and must deal with wounds that have never healed. \"Joshua Moehling is officially a force to be reckoned with, and A LONG TIME GONE proudly continues one of the best written mystery/thriller series on the market.\" When he was just a boy, Packard\u2019s older brother, Nick, walked out the back door of their home never to be seen or heard from again. He had been declared dead decades ago, but Packard and his family never recovered from the incident and experienced no closure. Suddenly new information arises that may indicate the location of Nick\u2019s body. This brings Packard\u2019s estranged mother back into town. They are both surprised to find that the woman who bought their old home recently died in a household accident when she was found on the floor with a broken neck. The death appeared to be suspicious, and Packard finds himself rooted in two separate but possibly related tragedies. Something as innocent as a photograph of Nick swimming in a nearby lake with two old friends sets Packard off on a hunt for answers. However, everyone he encounters who may have been around Nick the summer he disappeared comes across as untrustworthy and unnecessarily elusive. As frustrating as this is, he is not swayed in his efforts to learn the truth, and the novel\u2019s pace really picks up when he delves deeper into his past. The relationship between Packard and his mother is both stereotypical and comical, making for some welcome lighthearted moments amidst all of the darkness that the narrative brings. Joshua Moehling is officially a force to be reckoned with, and A LONG TIME GONE proudly continues one of the best written mystery/thriller series on the market.

            "review": " For fans of BEHOLD THE DREAMERS comes a compelling novel about a tightly bound Nigerian family living in Florida and the wounds that get passed down from generation to generation, from the author of the acclaimed MR. AND MRS. DOCTOR. When 276 schoolgirls are abducted from their school in Nigeria, Fidelis Ewerike, a Florida-based barrister, poet and former POW of the Nigerian Civil War, begins to go mad, consumed by memories of his younger sister, Ugochi, who went missing during that conflict. Consumed by survivor\u2019s guilt and fearful that the same fate awaits Amara, his 16-year-old daughter who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ugochi, Fidelis locks her in her bedroom, offering no words of explanation, only lovingly --- if poorly --- made meals and sweets. Amid that singular action, the Ewerike family spirals into chaos. After unsuccessful attempts to free her daughter from her room, his wife, Adaobi, seeks the counsel of a preacher, praying for spiritual liberation from the curse she is certain has plagued her family since leaving Nigeria. Fourteen-year-old Chuk, beset by his own war with the neighborhood boys, receives a painful education on force, masculinity, and his tenuous position within his family. And rebellious, resentful Amara is hungry for her life to be hers, so the moment she is able to escape her imprisonment, she falls in love --- not with the Aba-born engineer-in-training her mother envisages, but with Maksym Kostyk, the son of the town drunk. Before long, the two have concocted a plan to run away from the trappings of their familial traumas. Perfect for readers of SING, UNBURIED, SING, Julie Iromuanya's A SEASON OF LIGHT is an all-consuming masterpiece. To peer into the window of the Ewerike family\u2019s lives is a gift.",

            "review": " If you love sports, you probably have one that you prefer over the others. For me it is baseball, which I first enjoyed in the early 1950s when I sat in the right field bleachers of Wrigley Field as the Chicago Cubs played the Brooklyn Dodgers. In many respects, following a baseball season is like reading a novel. The story unfolds over some length of time, each day bringing new elements into the plot that ultimately will evolve into the postseason and the World Series. Just as in an exciting work of literature, you will encounter twists, turns, surprises, happiness and sadness. Perhaps because it is the longest of sports seasons (and it seems to get longer every year) and it offers so many unique occurrences, baseball is a game of memories for a lifetime. Even today, I still recall events that I witnessed live at baseball games in the \u201960s and \u201970s. In A TIME FOR REFLECTION, Jason Cannon celebrates the lives and careers of two baseball icons: Hall of Famers Willie McCovey and Billy Williams. \"Willie McCovey and Billy Williams were humble and kind men whose stories are wonderfully told in this exceptional biography.\" As a member of the San Francisco Giants, McCovey hit more than 500 home runs and was voted Most Valuable Player in the National League in 1969. He and Willie Mays dominated the Giants lineup in the \u201960s. Ironically, McCovey may be best known for making the final out of the 1962 World Series. With two runners on and the Yankees ahead 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth, McCovey smashed a line drive that was caught by Yankees second baseman Bobby Richardson. Inches either way, and the Giants would have won the World Series. Williams never made it to the World Series as he spent most of his career with the Chicago Cubs. The National League Rookie of the Year in 1961, he was a consistent .300 hitter and run producer for the Cubs. From 1963 to 1970, he played 1,117 consecutive games, a National League record that stayed intact until 1983. Cannon does a remarkable job of researching and putting into words the numerous achievements of McCovey and Williams. He benefited from interviewing many of their teammates, who willingly talked about their contributions to baseball as well as the adopted communities of San Francisco and Chicago. But the story truly begins in Mobile, Alabama, in 1938. The McCovey and Williams families experienced the evils of the segregated South and the economic struggles of the era. Both men grew up in strong families where hard work and Sunday church attendance were the rules. They would develop their baseball skills playing with Black teams made up of players who were many years older than them. When McCovey and Williams were nine years old, their world suddenly changed. The Brooklyn Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson in 1947, and Major League Baseball became a dream for every young player regardless of race. By the time McCovey was old enough for a professional contract, the Giants were actively scouting and recruiting Black players. At the age of 17, he traveled to a tryout camp and was signed by the Giants, who were still playing in New York. There he met Orlando Cepeda, who would be a teammate and lifelong friend. Both had very brief minor league careers, and by 1959 they were playing for the San Francisco Giants. As a teenager, Williams barnstormed with Black professional players, including Satchell Paige. In 1956, he signed with the Chicago Cubs for $200 a month and a bus ticket. He became a full-time major leaguer just five years later. A TIME FOR REFLECTION clearly recounts the racism that both players experienced. In the Texas League, they could not travel to games in Louisiana because state law prohibited mixed-race athletic contests. In other states, they stayed in separate hotels and ate in different restaurants than their teammates. At one point, Williams almost quit. But he was convinced by Buck O\u2019Neil, who would become the first Black coach in the major leagues, to stay the course. Willie McCovey and Billy Williams were humble and kind men whose stories are wonderfully told in this exceptional biography. Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman on February 14, 2025",

            "review": " In much the same way that writers and would-be writers are drawn to well-written accounts of other writers' processes and philosophies, as a voracious lifelong reader, I've always been fascinated by the attempts of others to understand how and why we read. I'm not talking about the science of how we acquire the ability to read --- though that also is an interesting topic --- but rather the intellectual pursuit of what draws us to read for pleasure, knowledge or connection, and how what we read shapes who we are. For that reason, despite or perhaps because of its provocative title, I was immediately drawn to BIBLIOPHOBIA. Best known as a literary critic and co-author of THE FERRANTE LETTERS, Sarah Chihaya opens her unusual memoir with a chapter also entitled \"Bibliophobia\" that explains the origins of the book's title. Here she begins to describe (though the most harrowing details are revealed later on) the mental breakdown that resulted in her hospitalization. As she explains, this breakdown always felt inevitable to her: \"It wasn't a surprise that I ended up in the hospital. The main surprise was how long it took me to get there.\" \"Some sections of BIBLIOPHOBIA come as close as anything I've read to describing some of the phenomenon of losing oneself in a book... BIBLIOPHOBIA is rich, complex and rewarding, as the very best reading should be.\" So for Chihaya, the most troubling aspect of her breakdown was not that it happened at all, but that it was accompanied by a truly disturbing side effect: she became profoundly disinterested in reading. \"Reading was my whole life, whether I liked it or not: My work life and my home life were built around reading, my physical space constructed by walls of books. All of them were useless to me now, and, looking at them, I felt nauseous.\" The balance of that opening chapter begins to trace the roots of her acute bibliophobia and also follows her as she finds, with the help of her friend and a particularly forceful book recommendation, her way out of it. Subsequent chapters delve into Chihaya's personal history as it intersects with specific books. This sounds like a rather superficial or simplistic way to structure a memoir, but I assure you that this surface description is not doing it justice. In these sections, she touches not only on the books themselves and where she was in her life when she first encountered them, but on a multitude of other topics that --- much like the process of being a lifelong reader --- spiral out from this center in intricate and intriguing ways. In a chapter on L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series, for example, Chihaya reflects not only on her own youthful reading habits, but on her country of origin (Canada) and her cultural heritage (Japanese). She ruminates about tidy narratives and if the stories we tell about ourselves are as carefully crafted as the novels we read. In addition, she reveals her early suicide attempts and reflects on Montgomery's own likely suicide. Some sections of BIBLIOPHOBIA come as close as anything I've read to describing some of the phenomenon of losing oneself in a book, and what that phrase even means when you think about it seriously: \"I didn't go to books to be a heroine. I went to books because I wanted to be --- nothing, nobody. I wanted nothing so much as to be a kind of sociable air, circulating invisibly in the room, necessary but never noticed.\" In most cases, later chapters focus largely on individual books (such as A.S. Byatt's POSSESSION or Toni Morrison's THE BLUEST EYE). But each carefully wrought chapter also introduces a host of other references and considerations, not to mention insights into Chihaya's own story, finally circling back to the events leading up to that breakdown. Inveterate readers will appreciate that Chihaya opens the volume with a comprehensive list of all the books considered within. Initially, the memoir can read like a series of personal essays on a common theme, but these chapters do gradually build on one another, as Chihaya's story becomes the narrative of her lifelong quest to find the book that will save her --- and her realization of the impossibility of that pursuit.

            "review": " Eowyn Ivey, the Pulitzer Prize finalist and New York Times bestselling author of THE SNOW CHILD,  returns to the mythical landscapes of Alaska with an unforgettable dark fairy tale that asks the question: Can love save us from ourselves? Birdie is keeping it together; of course she is. So she\u2019s a little hungover, sometimes, and she has to bring her daughter, Emaleen, to her job waiting tables at an Alaskan roadside lodge, but she\u2019s getting by as a single mother in a tough town. Still, Birdie can remember happier times from her youth, when she was free in the wilds of nature. Arthur Neilsen, a soft-spoken and scarred recluse who appears in town only at the change of seasons, brings Emaleen back to safety when she gets lost in the woods. Most people avoid him, but to Birdie, he represents everything she\u2019s ever longed for. She finds herself falling for Arthur and the land he knows so well. Against the warnings of those who care about them, Birdie and Emaleen move to his isolated cabin in the mountains, on the far side of the Wolverine River. It\u2019s just the three of them in the vast black woods, far from roads, telephones, electricity and outside contact, but Birdie believes she has come prepared. At first, it\u2019s idyllic and she can picture a happily ever after: Together they catch salmon, pick berries, and climb mountains so tall it\u2019s as if they could touch the bright blue sky. But soon Birdie discovers that Arthur is something much more mysterious and dangerous than she ever could have imagined and that like the Alaska wilderness, a fairy tale can be as dark as it is beautiful. BLACK WOODS, BLUE SKY is a novel with life-and-death stakes, about the love between a mother and daughter, and the allure of a wild life --- about what we gain and what it might cost us.",

            "review": " BONDED IN DEATH, the 60th book in J.D. Robb\u2019s futuristic police procedural series, is one of her smartest and most enthralling thrillers. It delves into personal themes such as loyalty, honor and betrayal while also delivering a tense and suspenseful read. Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the Homicide Division of the New York Police and Security Department is called to the scene of an elderly man who was found dead in a car and holding a business card that bears her name. The death is suspicious, and the card is an obvious fake, but Eve needs to know how she is connected to this crime. \"BONDED IN DEATH is a touching, thrilling and clever story that you will not want to put down for a minute.\" The deceased, Giovanni Rossi, recently arrived in New York City from Rome to keep an oath he made. Unfortunately, his widow in Italy has nothing more to offer. As usual, Eve brings her work home and creates a murder board, hoping that her husband, Roarke, can help her make sense of the evidence she has so far. She also believes that Summerset, Roarke\u2019s surrogate father and their household manager, will have some particular insights. He was in Europe during the Urban Wars of the 2020s and may be able to offer some information about the murder victim. When Summerset sees Giovanni\u2019s photo, he pales in shock. He recognizes the man as Wasp, a member of an elite undercover organization that he joined while serving as a medic during the wars. Summerset has always been hesitant to talk about that time in his life, but his experiences with the group are essential to Eve\u2019s investigation. With the help of her team, Eve interviews the surviving members of The Twelve. What they learn takes them down a trail of twists and turns that leads across international boundaries. With the cooperation of Interpol and other foreign agencies, they discover a complex web of deception and subterfuge that reveals a killer who is desperate for revenge. Eve embarks on a high-risk mission to thwart a kidnapping plot and another potential murder, culminating in a cunning interrogation scene that serves as the novel\u2019s dramatic climax. Eve, Roarke and Summerset are quite the team here. Summerset always has been an important person in Roarke\u2019s life. Despite their strong personalities, Eve and Summerset have tolerated each other as they have one thing in common: their love for Roarke. However, as the investigation evolves, Eve\u2019s relationship with Summerset deepens as she works to protect and honor his past and present life while bringing the murderer to justice. BONDED IN DEATH is a touching, thrilling and clever story that you will not want to put down for a minute. Reviewed by Jennifer McCord on February 21, 2025",

            "review": " What is the difference between men and women? Jennifer Finney Boylan, the bestselling author of SHE'S NOT THERE and co-author of MAD HONEY with Jodi Picoult, examines the divisions --- as well as the common ground --- between the genders and reflects on her own experiences, both difficult and joyful, as a transgender American. SHE'S NOT THERE was the first bestselling work written by a transgender American. Since its publication 20 years ago, Jennifer Finney Boylan has become the go-to person for insight into the impact of gender on our lives --- from the food we eat to the dreams we dream, both for ourselves and for our children. But CLEAVAGE is more than a deep dive into gender identity; it\u2019s also a look at the difference between coming out as trans in 2000 --- when many people reacted to Boylan\u2019s transition with love --- and the present era of blowback and fear. How does gender affect our sense of self? Our body image? The passage of time? The friends we lose --- and keep? Boylan considers her womanhood, reflects on the boys and men who shaped her, and reconceives of herself as a writer, activist, parent and spouse. With heart-wrenching honesty, she illustrates the feeling of liminality that followed her to adulthood, but demonstrates the redemptive power of love through it all. With Boylan\u2019s trademark humor and poignancy, CLEAVAGE is a sharp, witty and captivating look at the triumphs and losses of a life lived in two genders. It provides hope for a future in which we all have the freedom to live joyfully as men, as women and in the space between us.",

Means, motive and a mountain of evidence leave everyone believing she\u2019s guilty. Everyone, that is, except Willowjean \u201cWill\u201d Parker, who knows for a fact her boss is innocent.

            "review": " It\u2019s rare for a literary novelist to be as skilled as Ali Smith is at responding --- sometimes, it seems, at lightning speed --- to current political realities. Her Seasonal Quartet novels (actually more of a quintet with the addition of COMPANION PIECE), published in quick succession between 2016 and 2021, seemed to be responding, as if in real time, to the unfolding realities of Brexit. Now, in GLIFF, Smith brings readers a story of two siblings who are navigating a near-future Britain, the outlines of which feel all too relatable. The book opens with the children --- Briar, who\u2019s nonbinary, and their younger sister, Rose --- and their mother\u2019s boyfriend, Leif, bidding farewell to their mother outside a hotel. She plans to work there for a couple of weeks, standing in for her ill sister. \"GLIFF is a mysterious, satisfying novel in its own right. But a companion volume, GLYPH...comes out next year. Readers will look forward to putting together the puzzle.\" The family has been summarily evicted from their home --- an event signaled by a red line that\u2019s been painted around their row house (at the behest of their next-door neighbors, who didn\u2019t like the house blocking their view). Having moved into a camper van, Leif and the children awake to discover a red line encircling that as well. So they secretly decamp to an abandoned house belonging to a friend. Having settled Briar and Rose with a quantity of canned food, Leif leaves, heading back to the city --- temporarily, he promises --- to retrieve their mother. In Leif\u2019s absence, Rose becomes enamored of the horses that graze nearby (only growing more obsessed after Briar explains what an \u201cabattoir horse\u201d is). The children use all of their cash to purchase one from Colon, the young son of the landowner, and Rose names the horse Gliff. There\u2019s a lot about names in GLIFF, a phenomenon that won\u2019t be too surprising to those who have read Smith\u2019s prior work, which is often filled with linguistic playfulness and the breaking apart of words (including names). Briar provides a different name to each new acquaintance --- a form of chameleon-like impermanence that also may mirror their gender identity. At first, Briar thinks \u201cGliff\u201d is just a nonsense word, a sound that Rose chooses on a whim. Later on, however, Briar uses a dictionary to discover a more than page-long list of definitions for the word, including \u201ca substitute word for any word\u201d and \u201cthe twinkling of an eye.\u201d Portions of the book --- when the siblings are homesteading and meeting the horses, and when Briar encounters a secret communal living space housed in a shuttered school, not to mention a particularly memorable fable featuring a tyrant with a gold toilet --- feel somewhat out of time. But this is very much a novel of our times, specifically an uncomfortably near future, where electronic surveillance is omnipresent and people are in danger of disappearing once they\u2019re declared \u201cunverified\u201d: \u201cOne person here had been unverified for saying out loud that a war was a war when it wasn\u2019t permitted to call it a war. Another had found herself declared unverifiable for writing online that the killing of many people by another people was a genocide.\u201d Given this hazardous climate and the siblings\u2019 absence of guardians, it\u2019s perhaps inevitable that they grow separated. Less predictable is where Briar finds themself five years later, or the harrowing process they undergo to get there. When a figure from their past shows up at the factory where they work as a supervisor (overseeing staggeringly dangerous working conditions), Briar\u2019s past and present mingle, and they find a kind of courage foreshadowed in their own family history. GLIFF is a mysterious, satisfying novel in its own right. But a companion volume, GLYPH, which (in much the same way that the Seasonal Quartet books complemented one another) promises to \u201ctell a story hidden in the first novel,\u201d comes out next year. Readers will look forward to putting together the puzzle. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on February 15, 2025",

The extraordinary story of the woman who ignited the Harlem Renaissance, written by Victoria Christopher Murray, the New York Times bestselling coauthor of THE PERSONAL LIBRARIAN. In 1919, a high school teacher from Washington, D.C arrives in Harlem excited to realize her lifelong dream. Jessie Redmon Fauset has been named the literary editor of The Crisis. The first Black woman to hold this position at a preeminent Negro magazine, Jessie is poised to achieve literary greatness. But she holds a secret that jeopardizes it all. W. E. B. Du Bois, the founder of The Crisis, is not only Jessie\u2019s boss, he\u2019s her lover. And neither his wife nor their 14-year age difference can keep the two apart. Amidst rumors of their tumultuous affair, Jessie is determined to prove herself. She attacks the challenge of discovering young writers with fervor, finding 16-year-old Countee Cullen, 17-year-old Langston Hughes, and Nella Larsen, who becomes one of her best friends. Under Jessie\u2019s leadership, The Crisis thrives. Every African American writer in the country wants their work published there. When her first novel is released to great acclaim, it\u2019s clear that Jessie is at the heart of a renaissance in Black music, theater and the arts. She has shaped a generation of literary legends, but as she strives to preserve her legacy, she\u2019ll discover the high cost of her unparalleled success.",

            "review": " ISOLA is a stunning achievement that rivals Alexandre Dumas' and Victor Hugo's classic tales of adventure, survival and political intrigue. This gorgeous book by Allegra Goodman is about a woman who discovers her boldness and strength as the natural world around her reveals its most stinging and beautiful secrets. It is a story of woman vs. nature that will have readers riveted until the very last page. The heroine is Marguerite, heir to a ch\u00e2teau with its own village and properties. She is a child taken under the wing and supposed protection of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Rocque de Roberval, a volatile man who takes control of her life. He sells her land to pay his own debts and leaves her without a penny, then forces her to go with him on an expedition to New France. The only person who seems to truly care about her situation is one of Roberval\u2019s servants, a bold and intriguing man himself, and they fall in love. \"ISOLA is a stunning achievement that rivals Alexandre Dumas' and Victor Hugo's classic tales of adventure, survival and political intrigue.... In a world that's constantly changing, the emotional and deliberate intensity of this story can offer all of us a balm.\" When Roberval discovers their passion, he punishes them by abandoning them on a small island where nature threatens to destroy them. How will Isola fight back against natural forces to find purchase and safety in this wild world? That is the focus of ISOLA. Goodman has based this story on a real-life adventure, as a 16th-century noblewoman suffered this horror on an island off the coast of Canada. She deftly captures the frailty and desires of this young woman, as well as the full range of searching questions facing her amidst this danger and despair. Why is she being treated this way? What forces have led her to this moment of supreme abandonment? Is the God she was taught to love and fear looking out for her, or is this just another lie she was taught as a gullible child? Perhaps the best part of this adventure is how Marguerite learns to trust herself, to discover strengths she didn\u2019t know she had, and, above all, to show that she is a resilient and creative being who can fight against the best of what the world decides to throw at her. ISOLA is a magical and mesmerizing journey into one woman\u2019s soul and how she flowers under the most horrific circumstances. In our world of reality TV shows like \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cNaked and Afraid,\u201d the exploits of men and women who wish to push themselves against the terrific power of the natural world are on full display. However, these adventurers take on this journey with full acceptance, unlike Marguerite. It is not lost on Goodman\u2019s audience that the terms by which Marguerite must act are not exactly fair and represent the most difficult and horrific conditions in which any human can find himself or herself. With our extensive knowledge of how the natural world interacts with our own world, readers will connect most soundly to this incredible tale and the consequences that Marguerite faces. Goodman adds in a good dose of girl power for modern audiences, as well as a heavy helping of romance among the danger and derring-do. ISOLA is a story for the ages. In a world that's constantly changing, the emotional and deliberate intensity of this story can offer all of us a balm. As Marguerite builds a life with her own two hands, readers will find inspiration and exaltation in Allegra Goodman\u2019s poetic tale of human survival.

When Kate Gies was four years old, a plastic surgeon pressed a synthetic ear to the right side of her head and pulled out a mirror. He told her he could make her \u201cwhole\u201d --- could make her \u201cright\u201d --- and she believed him. From the ages of 4 to 13, she underwent 14 surgeries, including skin and bone grafts, to craft the appearance of an outer ear. Many of the surgeries failed, leaving permanent damage to her body. In short, lyrical vignettes, Kate writes about how her \u201cdisfigured\u201d body was scrutinized, pathologized and even weaponized. She describes the physical and psychic trauma of medical intervention and its effects on her sense of self, first as a child needing to be fixed and, later, as a teenager and adult navigating the complex expectations and dangers of being a woman. IT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL TO BE FINISHED is the story of a girl desperately trying to have a body that makes her acceptable and of a woman learning to own a body she has never felt was hers to define. In an age of speaking out about the abuse of marginalized bodies, this memoir takes a hard look at the role of the medical system in body oppression and trauma.",

            "review": " Fans of Pam Jenoff know that her historical novels don't just tell a story. They insert us right into the middle of shocking events most of us have never heard of that deserve to be exposed. The French capitulated to the Germans during WWII, and many didn't seem particularly opposed to assisting when it came to the impoundment of the Jewish French population. The French police joined in with the Gestapo to help round up the Jews of Paris, and many French citizens were only too happy to take for their own apartments that had belonged to Parisian Jews. Jenoff shares a little-known facet of that war in LAST TWILIGHT IN PARIS, a fictional account that takes place partly in L\u00e9vitan, the French furniture store that served as both a Jewish detention center and a shopping mecca for Nazi officers during the war. \"One of Jenoff's strengths as an author is her unerring ability to find obscure events that happened during WWII and tell them through the voices of fictional people she brings to life.... In LAST TWILIGHT IN PARIS, she has some truly clever twists in store for us as we try to reconcile the events in all the timelines.\" Jewish prisoners were housed in the store and forced to sort and polish the stolen belongings of the Jewish people whom the Germans sent to concentration camps. The story is told through the eyes of Helaine, a young Jewish woman who lives in Paris with her wealthy parents at the start of the novel, and Louise, who is from London and had volunteered for the Red Cross during the war. What connects these two ladies is a gold necklace called a mizpah, which Louise finds in 1953 at the bottom of a box of mostly rubbish that she sorts through at the local charity thrift shop. When she sees it, Louise is taken back to her time in the war, when she saw it in the hands of her friend, Franny. Jenoff is a master at doling out just a bit of information at a time so that we remain engrossed in the story and can't wait to uncover all the truths. We know that the necklace is important to Louise and that she feels some guilt related to it, but we don't know why. Franny\u2019s death has haunted Louise. When she discovers the necklace, which she is convinced is the same one because of a chip on the top, she is determined to find out what really happened and why Franny died. Jenoff unfolds the story through Louise's first person narrative and Helaine's third person narrative. At first, the different timelines are a bit confusing. But Jenoff repeats the pattern of a chapter with Helaine's narrative starting in 1938 and moving forward chronologically, and another chapter with Louise's narrative beginning in \"present-day\" 1953 and traveling back to 1944 to recount Louise's activities then. It's difficult to envision how Jenoff will pull it all together and what Louise will find out about the necklace and its missing half. These were the days before computers and the internet. All records were paper, and many were destroyed by the Germans at the end of the war. One of Jenoff's strengths as an author is her unerring ability to find obscure events that happened during WWII and tell them through the voices of fictional people she brings to life. In doing so, she shines a light not only on little-known atrocities, but also on small, inspiring acts of courage. While on one level we know that the characters are not real, we can't stop reading as we are invested in seeing how their stories play out. And Jenoff is a magnificent storyteller. In LAST TWILIGHT IN PARIS, she has some truly clever twists in store for us as we try to reconcile the events in all the timelines. Perhaps now, more than ever, it's important to read and share books that demonstrate the evil of unchecked power and the dangers in demonizing \"the other.\" Reading about Helaine and Louise, two ordinary women who might have been separated by the English Channel, religion and their war experiences, but were connected by their human emotions, we observe their love for their family and their struggle to make sense of a world gone crazy.

            "review": " On May 27, 2019 --- Memorial Day --- Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and historian Tony Horwitz collapsed and died on a Washington, DC sidewalk, less than two weeks before his 61st birthday. In her spare, beautiful memoir, MEMORIAL DAYS, his widow --- bestselling novelist and Pulitzer Prize winner Geraldine Brooks --- offers both a frank and moving portrait of her grief and a touching tribute to her late husband and the life they shared for more than three decades. Brooks received the news of Horwitz\u2019s death in an abrupt phone call from a resident at George Washington University Medical Center while alone at the home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard that they had shared since 2005. Their elder son, Nathaniel, was on a plane to Australia with his girlfriend, completing a post-college trip before starting his first job in Boston. Their younger son, Bizu, adopted at age five from Ethiopia and now a high school sophomore, was at his boarding school. As she raced to catch the plane in Boston that would take her to her brother-in-law\u2019s home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, Brooks describes the fog of bewilderment in which she lived as she struggled to process the reality that her husband \u201cwith the toned body of a six-day-a-week gym rat\u201d could be gone. \u201cHe\u2019s way too busy living,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe cannot possibly be dead.\u201d Her every attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible falls short. \"Despite her book\u2019s brevity, Brooks makes space for both informative and highly practical material.... Most people will find it easy to read MEMORIAL DAYS in a single sitting. The hard-earned lessons it imparts are ones that will endure for a lifetime.\" When he died, Horwitz indeed was busy living and working. He was nearing the end of an exhausting book tour to promote SPYING ON THE SOUTH, a work he produced while adhering to a punishing regimen that saw him consuming Nicorette gum by the box, nibbling the stimulant Provigil, and washing that down with pints of coffee, chasing those hours of concentrated effort with an intense workout at the gym. To bring himself down at night, Horwitz consumed large quantities of wine that had his cardiologist expressing concern about his drinking. When he reported a pair of episodes of shortness of breath during exercise, it was enough for the doctor to schedule a battery of tests. Sadly, that intervention came too late. Alternating with terse sections that describe the aftermath of Horwitz\u2019s death, ending with the autopsy result that reveals its cause, and then the interment of his ashes in August 2019, is the story of what Brooks calls her own \u201cmemorial days\u201d --- the several weeks she spent in February 2023 on tiny, remote Flinders Island, located off the northeast coast of Tasmania. The island, once part of a land bridge that connected Tasmania to Australia, Brooks\u2019 homeland, is home to barely a thousand people. Over the course of her visit, she resides alone in two different tiny shacks, the first of which is so spartan it lacks indoor plumbing. Nearly four years after Horwitz\u2019s passing, Brooks recognizes that she\u2019s never taken the time to properly mourn her loss, and this extended interlude is her attempt to compensate for the absence of an adequate expression of her grief. Fresh from a book tour for HORSE, she confesses to erecting \u201ca facade that I have hidden behind, a fugitive from my own feelings.\u201d She purposefully had dammed up a necessary flood of tears, admitting her fear \u201cthat if I started, I mightn\u2019t be able to stop,\u201d but now she is determined to \u201clet sadness come and accept it.\u201d Brooks wanders the gorgeous island, nourished by striking topography that features a \u201cjuxtaposition of earth and water even more marvelous than Big Sur,\u201d as she takes in its alluring flora and exotic nocturnal wildlife --- wallabies, pademelons and wombats. She spends hours paging through Horwitz\u2019s journals dating back to their days as graduate students at Columbia Journalism School, where they met in 1983, and reflecting on their illustrious professional careers, conjoined for a time when they both worked as correspondents for the Wall Street Journal and shared a prize for their coverage of the first Iraq War. Inevitably, Brooks feels \u201cfurious with death,\u201d cheated out of what she\u2019d always envisioned as many years of shared experience and accomplishment. Her emotions are a reminder that no days are promised to any of us, and time together can\u2019t be taken for granted at any age. But by the end of her sojourn, her solitary time in nature has brought her a measure of peace. Despite her book\u2019s brevity, Brooks makes space for both informative and highly practical material. She describes the memorial customs of various traditions, including the Judaism she converted to when she married Horwitz in 1984, and the one known as \u201cSorry Business\u201d among Australia\u2019s First Nations People, as well as revealing the tragic persecution of the native people on Flinders Island in the 1830s. Along with navigating some of the difficulties of the Massachusetts probate system, Brooks recounts the terror of finding out that the family\u2019s health insurance had been cancelled to illustrate the pitfalls of a marital division of labor. In their case, domestic chores fell to her, while Horwitz managed family finances. In the absence of meaningful overlap, she suggests that each spouse create a \u201cYour Life: How It Works\u201d document to make it easier for the survivor to navigate a solo future. Brooks mentions Joan Didion\u2019s THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING in passing, and the parallels between her experience and Didion\u2019s are inescapable. But as she makes clear, every experience of grief is singular, and when it\u2019s described with the emotional intelligence and eloquence of a writer like Brooks, it\u2019s well worth adding to the sizable pile of books on this universal subject. Most people will find it easy to read MEMORIAL DAYS in a single sitting. The hard-earned lessons it imparts are ones that will endure for a lifetime.

            "review": " There\u2019s a reason why studios release movies that they think have a good chance at the Oscars late in the year. Memories are short, and sometimes a film that comes out in February is forgotten by December. Unfortunately, the same phenomenon can happen with books. But I\u2019m making a note now not to forget about MUTUAL INTEREST when it comes time to compile \u201cbest books\u201d lists at the end of the year. I\u2019ve been anticipating this book for a while. Memories may be short, but Olivia Wolfgang-Smith\u2019s debut, GLASSWORKS, was one of my favorites when it came out in 2023. That novel --- which traced a history of glass through multiple generations of a family --- was in some ways more structurally complex than MUTUAL INTEREST. But her sophomore effort is no less satisfying as its storytelling is just as compelling. The first section introduces readers to its primary characters. They don\u2019t know each other then, but we meet them when they are still children or teenagers. \"MUTUAL INTEREST brilliantly explores the freedom that wealth affords its queer characters --- and the limitations that even wealth can\u2019t overcome.\" In 1898, Vivian Lesperance is a rambunctious rebel who is desperate to escape Utica and her parents\u2019 meanness and poverty. She is equally desperate to avoid marriage to a man, which her parents posit as her only way out, and begins to recognize her attraction to other girls. Oscar Schmidt, who is 20 years older than Vivian, grows up in central Ohio, confused and embarrassed by his attraction to other boys and (much like Vivian) desperate to escape to a place where his sexual orientation is less likely to mark him as strange. He finds freedom --- and a career in the soap-making business --- in New York City. Squire Clancy is a native New Yorker, raised in a loveless but fabulously wealthy household. As a child, his peculiarities are not around sexual orientation but his tendency to become transfixed by the strangest topics, from dinosaur fossils to sewer systems. As a young man, he becomes obsessed with the notion (outlandish at the time) of making scented candles. His path first crosses with Oscar\u2019s after he corners the market on scented plants in order to conduct his experiments, stymying Oscar\u2019s soap-making business. Oscar and Vivian --- who connected at a couple of parties and saw in one another kindred spirits of a sort --- already have established something of a marriage of convenience by the time Squire enters their lives. What began as a professional rivalry soon develops into something very different, as the three of them enter into business --- and unconventional personal and professional relationships that serve each of them very well indeed. As I mentioned, MUTUAL INTEREST is a fairly straightforward historical novel. It unfolds more or less chronologically, with storytelling that in some ways feels almost old-fashioned. But it\u2019s also a thoroughly contemporary novel, inasmuch as it seeks to place fascinating, even inspiring, queer stories into the conventional Gilded Age narratives of wealth and power. Vivian is a fascinating character. Finding herself on the margins of New York society, she learns through observation and her own shrewdness how to manipulate that society to her own ends, and she\u2019s fabulously successful at doing so. But even as she utilizes her relationship with Oscar and Squire (and their romantic relationship with each other) to acquire professional power practically unheard of for a woman of her time, she also bumps up against barriers to that power. Likewise, MUTUAL INTEREST brilliantly explores the freedom that wealth affords its queer characters --- and the limitations that even wealth can\u2019t overcome.

Psychologist Alex Delaware and Homicide Detective Milo Sturgis race against time to find a twisted killer in this riveting thriller from the #1 New York Times bestselling \u201cmaster of suspense\u201d (Los Angeles Times). People come to Los Angeles to chase their dreams. Sometimes they find themselves cast into a nightmare. And sometimes, the most ardent dreamers turn out to be the most vicious monsters. The body of an aspiring actress is found dumped near a hospital emergency room. She\u2019s been drugged and murdered, and the motive for the callous crime remains maddeningly out of reach. Until a prime suspect materializes. Another Hollywood hopeful. Only to be shot dead by a sniper using a weapon that turns out to have been catalogued in a previous murder. And another before that. It\u2019s not long before more bodies begin piling up. What makes the murderous spree baffling is the apparent lack of connection among the victims. Is this the work of a random thrill killer, the toughest of all cases to unravel? But as Alex and Milo dig deeper they\u2019re faced with an even knottier scenario: a highly complex killer with deep-seated motivation that will require all of their highly honed skills to decipher. The latest page-turner from #1 New York Times bestseller Jonathan Kellerman is a tale of psychological complexity, dark suspense and shocking surprises. A wild ride through L.A.\u2019s surreal underbelly climaxed by an edge-of-the chair conclusion.",

            "review": " In June 1942, Etta Shiber was headed back to New York and away from Paris, where she had been a visitor, a citizen and an eventual inmate. Her liberation from Nazi captivity took over a year, but a compassionate release due to her failing health combined with diplomatic maneuverings paved the way. While free from the spartan conditions and harsh treatment of the Nazis, Etta ruminated on the well-being of her best friend and roommate, Kate Bonnefous. Kate was the initiator of the bold decision to aid in the escape of captive Allied soldiers in the early days of World War II. Etta was a New Yorker who had lived an unassuming existence until Europe descended into a martial environment and Paris was soon occupied. She had met Kate in 1926 when she was on vacation in Paris with her husband. The pair became fast friends, and Kate was a source of emotional support when Etta suffered the dual loss of her husband and a close cousin. She encouraged Etta to relocate to Paris, where the two resided until 1940. \"PARIS UNDERCOVER is a magnificent and in-depth re-examination of atypical heroines carrying out acts of gallantry.... This impressive effort functions as both a dual memoir and a wartime story, and you will not want to miss it.\" Kate was born into an affluent English family but was forced to cope with adversity when she lost both her parents in two years. As the eldest child, she needed to step up and arrange the care and guardianship of her siblings when her extended family balked at taking them in. Kate was a determined woman full of vigor who bucked social norms. Whereas Kate could be bold, Etta was timid and often beset by crippling anxiety. Kate was a person of action, and she dove headfirst into volunteer work at the commencement of the Second World War. Whether working at hospitals or serving as a defense warden, her devotion was unquestioned. Upon reading about wounded British soldiers being held by the enemy, Kate set upon an intrepid course of action with deadly consequences if caught. She would visit a convalescent soldier and make her proposal to abet in their flight for freedom. Etta would be fraught with anxiety when Kate informed her of this, but her loyalty to her friend outweighed her nerves. The operation would be unraveled within six months of its initiation as Kate, Etta and others were arrested. However, the impact of their contribution couldn\u2019t be minimized, and while the Nazi government sought retribution, the press would see banner headlines meant to win hearts and minds. PARIS UNDERCOVER is a magnificent and in-depth re-examination of atypical heroines carrying out acts of gallantry. The historical record was flawed, but author Matthew Goodman\u2019s comprehensive research elucidates the actions of Kate Bonnefous, Etta Shiber and others in 1940 when Europe was being overrun by the blitzkrieg of the Third Reich. The number of soldiers given shelter and assistance by Kate and her network was impressive. Kate and Etta\u2019s story was meant to be told, but foolhardy decision-making coupled with greed led to a whitewashing of the truth. The compelling nature of the narrative is consistent, from the women\u2019s path into each other\u2019s lives to their subversive activities in a locked-down city to their harrowing incarcerations. This impressive effort functions as both a dual memoir and a wartime story, and you will not want to miss it. Reviewed by Philip Zozzaro on February 21, 2025",

Armed with this insight, she allows herself to look with the eye of an artist at the wounds she suffered and come to understand the transformational power this has to restore her soul. By turns candid and lyrical, stoic and forgiving, blunt and evocative, READING THE WAVES reframes memory to show how crucial this process can be to gaining a deeper understanding of ourselves.",

William Boyle is the master of Brooklyn-set crime fiction, and SAINT OF THE NARROWS STREET is his magnum opus. For fans of \"The Sopranos,\" Jonathan Lethem and Dennis Lehane. Gravesend, Brooklyn, 1986: Risa Franzone lives in a ground-floor apartment on Saint of the Narrows Street with her bad-seed husband, Saverio, and their eight-month-old baby, Fabrizio. On the night Risa's younger sister, Giulia, moves in to recover from a bad breakup, a fateful accident occurs: Risa, boiled over with anger and fear, strikes a drunk, erratic Sav with a cast-iron pan, killing him on the spot. The sisters are left with a choice: notify the authorities and make a case for self-defense, or bury the man's body and go on with their lives as best they can. In a moment of panic, in the late hours of the night, they call upon Sav's childhood friend --- the sweet, loyal Christopher \"Chooch\" Gardini --- to help them, hoping they can trust him to carry a secret like this. Over the vast expanse of the next 18 years, life goes on in the working-class Italian neighborhood of Gravesend as Risa, Giulia, Chooch and eventually Fabrizio grapple with what happened that night. A standout work of character-driven crime fiction from a celebrated author of the form, SAINT OF THE NARROWS STREET is a searing and richly drawn novel about the choices we make and how they shape our lives.",

In the tradition of EVICTED and INVISIBLE CHILD, Jeff Hobbs masterfully explores America\u2019s housing crisis through the real-life story of Evelyn. This is Hobbs\u2019 first book since THE SHORT AND TRAGIC LIFE OF ROBERT PEACE that focuses on a single character and her extraordinarily illuminating journey. In 2018, poverty and domestic violence cast Evelyn and her children into the urban wilderness of Los Angeles, where she avoids the family crisis network that offers no clear pathway for her children to remain together and in a decent school. For the next five years, Evelyn works full time as a waitress yet remains unable to afford legitimate housing or qualify for government aid. All the while she strives to provide stability, education, loving memories and college aspirations for her children even as they sleep in motels and in her car, living in fear of both her ex and the nation\u2019s largest child welfare agency. Eventually Evelyn encounters Wendi Gaines, a recently trained social worker who decades earlier survived her own abusive marriage and housing crisis. Evelyn becomes one of Wendi\u2019s first clients, and the relationship transforms them both. Told from the perspectives of Evelyn, Wendi, and Evelyn\u2019s teenage son, Orlando, SEEKING SHELTER is a powerful and urgent exploration of the issues of homelessness, poverty and education in America --- a must-read for anyone interested in understanding not just social inequality and economic disparity in our society but also the power of a mother\u2019s love and vision for her kids.",

            "review": " Sarah Perry's first book, AFTER THE ECLIPSE, was a harrowing memoir about her mother's murder when Perry was 12. Although it might seem like she has chosen a topic (candy) in complete opposition to her debut for her sophomore effort, there's still more than a little sour and salt mixed into the sweet. And this wonderful essay collection is all the better for it. Perry sets the tone with \"On Root Beer Barrels,\" which is the longest essay in the book. Not only does it discuss the titular candy, it offers a brief history of her home state of Maine's favorite soda (Moxie), which then gets wrapped up in a hilariously detailed account of her largely failed attempts to treat the raging yeast infection she picked up while on tour for AFTER THE ECLIPSE. At the time, she was contending with resurgent grief dredged up by writing and publishing a book about her late mom. You get the idea right from the beginning; this might be a sweet book about candy, but it's not just about candy, and it's not always that sweet. \"Here's hoping that this thoroughly delectable essay collection prompts many readers to (re)discover their own sweet tooth --- and cherish their wild, precious memories.\" Candy gives SWEET NOTHINGS its structure, though. Well, candy and color, since after that introductory piece, the 100 essays making up this slim but surprisingly dense (surely there's a candy metaphor here?) volume are grouped by color and arranged like a rainbow --- from the \"chewy reds\" of Twizzlers, Pop Rocks and Swedish Fish all the way through to the pink of Starburst and cotton candy. And not to worry, chocolate fans (whom Perry certainly would count herself among), she also includes lengthy collections of candies that fall under \"dark chocolate brown\" (including York Peppermint Patties, her mom's favorite), \"pale brown\" (Payday, Werther's Original), and \"milk chocolate brown\" (Twix and Toblerone, among others). Some essays are as brief as a short paragraph; others expand over pages. In some, the candy is the essay. Perry, a true aficionado, is remarkably adept at chronicling the most minute details of candy, from its appearance to the way it melts (or doesn't) in your mouth, to which candy wrappers are well designed and which are just annoying (yes, we're looking at you, Snickers!). In some cases, she offers scientific or historical context, or bits of trivia. Perhaps unsurprisingly, even though she is an unapologetic adult candy lover, many of the candies prompt Perry to cast her mind back to her childhood. She thinks about her mom, her mom's boyfriend and other relatives --- both before and after her mom's death --- as well as candies that, inevitably like childhood itself, have been discontinued. Sometimes the juxtapositions are funny, sad, sexy or wild --- as when she writes about \"unnamed Scandinavian candy eaten in San Pedro, Guatemala,\" comparing it unfavorably (and hilariously) to the orgy she had on that same trip. I remember years ago, when my parents had just finished reading Steve Almond's CANDY FREAK, they became obsessed with tracking down a couple of the candies that he wrote about. SWEET NOTHINGS is a very different book, but I\u2019ve had a similar reaction. I now have a short (ok, long) list of candies to find, ones that Perry describes so lovingly and either I've never tried or I\u2019d forgotten entirely until she jogged my memory. Here's hoping that this thoroughly delectable essay collection prompts many readers to (re)discover their own sweet tooth --- and cherish their wild, precious memories.

            "review": " Cannibals are having a moment. Or, perhaps, as symbols of death, destruction, gluttony and desire, they have long-held outsized attention relative to how very rare cannibalism really is. This horror is fertile ground for writers, and debut novelist Lucy Rose was not afraid to take it on in THE LAMB, a strange, gory and emotionally dense story of a mother and daughter with a taboo diet. Margot is just about 11 years old and has lived all her life with her mother, Ruth, in a small, dilapidated and moldy house far from neighbors. The walls are damp, the corners are full of cobwebs, and the bathtub drain is clogged with human fingers and rot. Before it was only Mama and Margot, Papa was there, too. But for Margot, Papa is a very distant memory; all she knows is that he left. The near-isolated life that Margot and Ruth share is punctuated with the arrivals of strays and the school bus. And then a third arrival threatens their already fragile life in the woods. \"[T]he prose is really good, Margot is quite compelling, and overall this is a creepy and atmospheric read. THE LAMB heralds a promising new talent.\" Margot attending the local school, driven back and forth by a concerned bus driver named Steve, makes little sense in Rose\u2019s otherwise singular set, especially given Ruth\u2019s extreme dysfunction and paranoia. Still, it does give Margot the chance to interact with others --- from Steve to a short-tempered teacher to a sweet friend named Abbie. One of the many truths that complicate Margot\u2019s life is that Abbie\u2019s father is having an affair with Ruth. Somehow, Abbie\u2019s father, who Margot refers to as the gamekeeper, is entranced by the filthy and carnal Ruth and often visits the dirty house in the woods. But he is not a stray. Strays are those who get lost in the woods close to the house or have car trouble on the nearest road. Strays are those who, unfortunately, accept Ruth\u2019s offer of hospitality and never leave her house again. Strays are the meat that feed Ruth and Margot. Eden shows up at the house one day, and Margot (as well as readers) never learn much about her. She seems to know about Ruth\u2019s crimes and cannibalism right away, and immediately they begin a love affair. Eden is tender toward Margot but is mostly focused on Ruth and their shared cravings. As the days and weeks go by, Margot is all but forgotten as Ruth and Eden become increasingly intertwined. But when Eden\u2019s attention eventually turns back to Margot, Margot realizes that any precarious safety she enjoyed is gone. THE LAMB\u00a0is a dark novel --- part twisted fairy tale, part postmodern horror. At its heart, and beyond all the gristle and blood, it\u2019s about a young girl and her relationship with her irreparably and mysteriously damaged mother. Margot is both sheltered from the world and exposed to her mother\u2019s gruesome acts. She loves her but also fears her. And over the course of the novel, she arrives at grim realizations concerning how her mother feels about her. Like girls in many coming-of-age stories, Margot is separating from her but still clinging to her. There are inconsistencies in the book, and careful scrutiny reveals some flaws. Rose asks readers to make some mental leaps that are not always well supported in the storytelling. Still, the prose is really good, Margot is quite compelling, and overall this is a creepy and atmospheric read. THE LAMB heralds a promising new talent.

And no one is more sympathetic than a mother whose child faces a life-threatening illness. But what if the mother is the cause of the illness? What if the sympathy is the point? Munchausen by proxy (MBP) has fascinated and horrified both professionals and the general public since this disturbing form of child abuse was first identified. But even as the public has been captivated by these tales of abuse and deception, there remains widespread misinformation and confusion about MBP. Are these mothers unfeeling psychopaths, or sick women who need help? And more important, how can we protect the children whose lives are at stake? THE MOTHER NEXT DOOR offers a groundbreaking look at MBP from an unlikely duo: a Seattle novelist whose own family was torn apart by it, and the Texas detective who has worked on more medical child abuse cases than anyone in the nation. Readers ride along on three high-stakes MPB investigations; through riveting reporting and shocking stories from the family members, friends and doctors caught in the blast zone of these unthinkable acts, a twisted portrait of motherhood and deceit is revealed. With help from some of the top MBP experts in the world, Dunlop and Weber uncover the complex maze of psychological, systemic and cultural issues that compound MBP and offer solutions for how we might find our way out.",

Kim and Grant are at a turning point. A couple for 30 years, their \"separate but together\" partnership is running up against the realities of late middle age: Grant\u2019s mother has died, the college where he taught philosophy was shuttered, and their twin girls are grown and gone. Escaping the bitter cold of a Midwestern winter for the hot desert sun of Palm Springs seems as good a solution as any to the more intractable problems they face. When they arrive at Le Desert, a quirky condo community where everyone knows everyone\u2019s business, Kim immediately embraces the opportunity to make new friends and explore a more adventurous side of her personality. Meanwhile, Grant struggles to find his footing in this unfamiliar landscape, leaving Kim to wonder if their relationship can survive the snowbird season. But when Grant goes missing on a hike in the Palm Springs mountains, Kim is forced to consider two terrifying outcomes: either Grant is truly lost, or this time, he\u2019s really left her. Is it ever too late to become the person we wanted to be --- and is there still time to change into someone better? The exhilarating but often confusing transitions of midlife are pitched against the promise and glamour of Palm Springs in this tender, honest story of what it takes to commit to someone for a lifetime. With compassion and humor, Clancy explores the redemptive power of finding ourselves, and of being found.",

            "review": " An intimate and lyrical celebration of great love, great art, and the sacrifices we make for both. For 50 years, Abe and Jane have been coming to Central Park, as starry-eyed young lovers, as frustrated and exhausted parents, as artists watching their careers take flight. They came alone when they needed to get away from each other, and together when they had something important to discuss. The Park has been their witness for half a century of love. Until now. Jane is dying, and Abe is recounting their life together as a way of keeping them going: the parts they knew --- their courtship and early marriage, their blossoming creative lives --- and the parts they didn\u2019t always want to know --- the determined young student of Abe\u2019s looking for a love story of her own, and their son, Max, who believes his mother chose art over parenthood and who has avoided love and intimacy at all costs. Told in various points of view, even in conversation with Central Park itself, these voices weave in and out to paint a portrait as complicated and essential as love itself. An homage to New York City, to romance and even to loss, THIS IS A LOVE STORY tenderly and suspensefully captures deep truths about life and marriage in radiant prose. It is about love that endures despite what life throws at us, or perhaps even because of it.",

            "review": " Winifred Notty is a character like no other, and one you\u2019ll probably hope never to meet again. I\u2019m almost afraid to introduce you to her. She has left quite a lot of --- shall we call them --- eye-opening deeds in her past. Devastating would be more accurate. Over her short career, Winifred has been employed as a governess for several families. We don\u2019t know exactly how many, which may be for the best. She will admit that her last engagement might have ended under a bit of a cloud. But she has just arrived at Ensor House and vows to put all that unpleasantness behind her. She tells herself that this time will be different. All it will take is keeping the Darkness under control. Starting anew, she\u2019ll be the perfect governess for the Pounds children, Drusilla and Andrew, even though they are despicable little snots. \"VICTORIAN PSYCHO takes a strong stomach to read through. It\u2019s a small book with a big message, so it\u2019s more than worth the journey.\" It is the run-up to Christmas, and Winifred would like to enjoy a pleasant yuletide this year. If only the people at Ensor House would stop annoying her. Mr. and Mrs. Pounds are growing more and more insufferable by the day. Drusilla and Andrew don\u2019t seem interested in learning anything. And the other servants are all sycophants. Winifred can\u2019t understand protocols, and the class system that\u2019s rampant at the time is absurd, not to mention often advantageous to idiots.\u00a0As for the double standard between women and men, she simply refuses to play by those rules. As the big day grows closer, the Darkness in Winifred is fighting hard to get out. It is, in fact, germinating an idea for a very special gift to be given to the Pounds family. In the meantime, though, she tries to settle into the routine of her job. Oddly enough, she doesn\u2019t like children much, which makes her choice of profession somewhat ridiculous. But if she were to be honest, she doesn\u2019t especially like people of any size or age, so finding a suitable line of work would be difficult in any case. However, governess at Ensor House will do nicely for now. Winifred just needs to tamp down the Darkness within her, and life here will run smoothly. But she feels it growing restless. Considering everything she has to put up with, it won\u2019t be her fault if she can\u2019t control it. Mr. Pounds doesn\u2019t even try to keep his wandering eye --- an eye that tends to travel toward her ample cleavage --- to himself. When this happens, she simply has to use it to her advantage. The opportunity is too rich, and Mr. Pounds is too easy of a victim. The lady of the house, though, is another matter entirely. Mrs. Pounds will require a different sort of attention, and she knows just what that is. Meanwhile, Winifred bides her time, which is growing short, at least in part because of her insidious quirks --- biting, ear licking, humorous taunts about eating children. These behaviors already have earned her an unsavory reputation among the rest of the Ensor House staff. She simply must hold out until Christmas. And she does. But then the storm hits, right during the Christmas dinner party, trapping the guests at Ensor House. Too bad for them. Virginia Feito\u2019s VICTORIAN PSYCHO takes a strong stomach to read through. It\u2019s a small book with a big message, so it\u2019s more than worth the journey. It attacks societal norms of the day and rips them apart --- or at least Winifred Notty does. And speaking of Winifred, it seems highly unlikely that anyone will fall in love with her. But no one will forget her --- or this novel. Reviewed by Kate Ayers on February 14, 2025",

When Theresa Okokon was nine, her father traveled to his hometown in Nigeria to attend his mother\u2019s funeral\u2026and never returned. His mysterious death shattered Theresa as her family\u2019s world unraveled. Now a storyteller and television cohost, Okokon sets out to explore the ripple effects of that profound loss and the way heartache shapes our sense of self and of the world --- for the rest of our lives. Using her grief and her father\u2019s death as a backdrop, Okokon delves deeply into intrinsic themes of Blackness, African spirituality, family, abandonment, belonging, and the seemingly endless, unrequited romantic pursuits of a Black woman who came of age as a Black girl in the Wisconsin suburbs where she was --- in many ways --- always an anomaly.",

            "review": " One of James Patterson\u2019s longest-running series, outside of the Alex Cross thrillers that put him on the map, features NYPD Detective Michael Bennett. James O. Born teams up with Patterson once again for its 17th installment, PARANOIA. Michael Bennett has an enormous clan. There is always something going on with one or more of the Bennetts, and this book is no exception as Bennett\u2019s wife, Mary Catherine, is having a difficult pregnancy. Meanwhile, Bennett is on the trail of an individual who is targeting certain members of a famed NYPD team and killing them one by one. This special assignment unit is run by NYPD Inspector Celeste Cantor, and the members of the team --- who are called the Land Sharks --- are mostly retired but still in the crosshairs of a killer with very personal reasons for wanting them dead. \"Patterson and Born\u2019s ultra-short chapters help build the suspense, which reaches unbearable levels. Readers will enjoy riding shotgun once again with Michael Bennett as he is determined to outwit and stay out of the crosshairs of a relentless killer.\" Bennett is attending the funeral of Lou Sanvos, a beloved ex-cop and personal friend of his. A former member of the Land Shark crew, he died when he allegedly lost control of his vehicle and crashed into the front window of a Westchester store. Shortly after learning this information, we meet Kevin Doyle, who is also at the funeral. He is not a friend or a former cop, but the man who tapped Lou\u2019s front bumper at high speed to send him careening to his death. We then learn of the alleged suicides of two more ex-members of the Land Sharks who had retired and were living in Florida. Bennett begins to put two and two together and takes on this case, which is now extremely personal for him. We also follow the path of Mr. Doyle, who seems to feel that the murders he has committed are still not punishment enough for whatever vendetta he is fulfilling. It becomes apparent that he is a professional killer who has learned to disassociate himself from his victims and kill indiscriminately for the right price. Bennett has to look closely into each death that already has occurred, along with those who might be the next victims. He needs to put together some type of a motive for these horrific acts, but initially he comes up empty. Once Bennett gets down to Florida for that leg of the special assignment, he begins to see the situation more clearly and realizes that he is dealing with an experienced assassin. He also ends up getting himself added to the kill list, which puts his life and those of his entire family at risk. Patterson and Born\u2019s ultra-short chapters help build the suspense, which reaches unbearable levels. Readers will enjoy riding shotgun once again with Michael Bennett as he is determined to outwit and stay out of the crosshairs of a relentless killer. The book also goes to great lengths to make us understand, if not sympathize with, this twisted individual --- which gives a different spin on what could have become formulaic action.

To some, Maya represents the American dream. To others, a gold digger. But when Colin's cousin Arianna, the heiress to the family's immense fortune, is found murdered, Maya is thrust into the spotlight: first as she is revealed to be the next heiress to the fortune, and then as the prime suspect.

Now, she has no choice but to find and expose the truth hidden within the Sterling family, and why Arianna, a girl she had never met, chose her to take her place. But Maya has secrets of her own.

In an aging timber house hand-built into the Absaroka-Beartooth mountains, two brothers are struggling to keep up with their debts. They live off the grid, on the fringe of Yellowstone, surviving off the wild after the death of their father. Thad, the elder, is more capable of engaging with things like the truck registration, or the medical bills they can\u2019t afford from their father\u2019s fatal illness, or the tax lien on the cabin their grandfather built, while Hazen is\u2026different, more instinctual, and deeply in tune with the natural world. Desperate for money, they are approached by a shadowy out-of-towner with a dangerous proposition that will change both of their lives forever. BEARTOOTH is a fast-paced tale with moments of surprising poignancy set in the grandeur of the American West. Evoking the timeless voices of American pastoral storytelling, this is a bracing, masterful novel about survival, revenge and the bond between brothers.",

            "review": " Jo Nesb\u00f8, world-famous for his outstanding Harry Hole mysteries, steps away from the series to pen another stand-alone novel. BLOOD TIES is the tale of two brothers, corruption and small-town secrets, all told in classic noir style. The second chapter poses an interesting question: \u201cCan anyone be a killer?\u201d Our narrator, Roy Opgard, and his brother, Carl, live in the small town of Os. Their family has had a long-standing history of successful businesses there. Now that they are the last of the Opgards left, they are trying to keep Carl\u2019s spa and hotel and Roy\u2019s automotive shop running as efficiently as possible. \"BLOOD TIES is a solid read, and it\u2019s so nice to see the classic crime noir framework applied to a Norwegian landscape, which makes the proceedings all the more foreign and chillier.\" Sheriff Kurt Olsen already resents Roy for allegedly sleeping with his wife. Now, he believes he has DNA evidence that connects the Opgard brothers and their late father to an old murder. The victim happens to be Olsen\u2019s father. Olsen is on a roll with this discovery and feels he may have unearthed a string of unsolved murders that he would love to pin on his archnemesis. Meanwhile, Roy is trying to keep a low profile as he continues to press the bank officer to secure a loan for him to build an amusement park with a monster roller coaster. However, the town is threatening to do a major refacing in the form of a new highway that would all but eliminate the area where Roy would like to fulfill his long-standing dream. With the occasional help of his untrustworthy brother, Roy attempts to come out on top regarding the old murder allegation. At the same time, he is blackmailing both the bank officer --- who may be leading a secret gay life behind his wife\u2019s back --- and the town commission seeking to install the new roadway. In the hands of a master plotter like Nesb\u00f8, this is easily done and is an absolute pleasure to see. With a target clearly on his back, readers get to watch the exceedingly clever Roy as he skates on very thin ice to see all of his goals come to fruition. It does not make it any easier when Carl attempts to block him with a counterproposal that he never saw coming. What remains in the background this entire time is that Roy may indeed be a skilled killer, and anyone who crosses him better watch out before they end up being just another unsolved murder case. BLOOD TIES is a solid read, and it\u2019s so nice to see the classic crime noir framework applied to a Norwegian landscape, which makes the proceedings all the more foreign and chillier. There is nothing that Jo Nesb\u00f8 cannot do, and his loyal fans should simply eat this one up. Reviewed by Ray Palen on February 21, 2025",

Prudence Wright seems to have it all: a loving husband, Davis; a spacious home in Washington, D.C.; and the former glories of a successful career at McKinsey, which now enables her to dedicate her days to her autistic son, Roland. When she and Davis head out for dinner with one of Davis\u2019 new colleagues on a stormy summer evening filled with startling and unwelcome interruptions, Prudence has little reason to think that certain details of her history might arise sometime between cocktails and the appetizer course. Yet when Davis\u2019 colleague turns out to be Matshediso, a man from Prudence\u2019s past, she is transported back to the formative months she spent as a law student in South Africa in 1996. As an intern at a Johannesburg law firm, Prudence attended sessions of the Truth and Reconciliation hearings that uncovered the many horrors and human rights abuses of the Apartheid state, and which fundamentally shaped her sense of righteousness and justice. Prudence experienced personal horrors in South Africa as well, long hidden and now at risk of coming to light. When Matshediso finally reveals the real reason behind his sudden reappearance, he will force Prudence to examine her most deeply held beliefs and excavate inner reserves of resilience and strength. Lauren Francis-Sharma\u2019s previous two novels have established her as a deft chronicler of history and its intersections with flawed humans struggling to find peace in unjust circumstances. With keen insight and gripping tension, CASUALTIES OF TRUTH explosively mines questions of whether we are ever truly able to remove the stains of our past and how we may attempt to reconcile with unquestionable wrongs.",

            "review": " As we age, our childhood memories can take on a dreamy quality. Are we remembering everything accurately? Are we creating memories from what we have been told? How do our adult perspective and knowledge fill in important gaps as we piece together the stories of our past? Debut novelist Krystelle Bamford takes on the fuzziness of memory while honoring the impact of the emotions and the reality of familial complexities in IDLE GROUNDS. The book follows a gaggle of very young cousins during a full day of a family birthday gathering. Not only does this pivotal day change the family forever, robbing the children of a sense of safety, it lingers in the mind of the narrator as magically frightening and still full of discovery, joy and beauty before a horrific event. \"Bamford\u2019s style is bright and clever, and the book is easy to read and challenging in the way of great literature. It is weird, wonderful and highly recommended.\" The family at the center of IDLE GROUNDS has long been connected to the semi-rural land where Aunt Frankie lives in the house she built herself. On one side of her property are her horses; on another edge, past the driveway, are mysterious woods and the house where the family matriarch once lived. Beezy, an enigmatic and almost legendary figure to her grandchildren, looms large in the novel. Only one of the cousins, who range in age from about three to 14, ever met her. All of them are starting to sense or understand that their parents, Beezy\u2019s five children, had fraught and even terrible relationships with her. Beezy is just one of the topics of conversation that the parents and their partners discuss when they gather together on days like this. As the grown-ups talk, the cousins roam the house and try to catch sight of what is zipping back and forth at the edge of the yard from an upstairs window. Then, one of them, three-year-old Abi, disappears. Thus begins the primary action of the novel --- the frantic search for Abi and then for her older brother, Travis, who had been their leader and hero. The search for Abi, and eventually Travis, leads the cousins across Frankie\u2019s property and then across an almost mystical threshold into the woods and to other houses and yards. As they get farther from their parents and from Frankie\u2019s place, they find themselves confronting uncertainties and dangers, as well as shifting loyalties among themselves. They experience pleasure and heartbreak from moment to moment. The unnamed narrator speaks for all the cousins and through their own particular adult lens. Process of elimination gives readers an idea of who the narrator\u2019s parents are. But for the most part, they are the voice of all the cousins. Yet, even as they begin as a group, the tragic day destroys their collective identity. This slippery viewpoint is just one of the interesting ways in which Bamford tells this surprising and unforgettable end-of-innocence story. In her talented hands, memory is both essential and unreliable. Pensive and lush, yet sharp and funny, IDLE GROUNDS is such a unique novel. It is a story in which shadows, unrealized dreams,\u00a0violence and the unexplained run parallel to the more mundane world of\u00a0family drama and June afternoons.\u00a0Bamford\u2019s style is bright and clever, and the book is easy to read and challenging in the way of great literature. It is weird, wonderful and highly recommended. Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman on February 14, 2025",

            "review": " The inside cover page of NEMESIS features a huge X, which is perfect as this is the 10th installment in Gregg Hurwitz's stellar Orphan X series. It also proves to be the most personal mission yet for Evan Smoak. On the dedication page, Hurwitz includes a poignant quote from Tommy Stojack: \"A friend's a person who's right when they tell you you're wrong.\" Tommy is Evan\u2019s best friend who supplies him with much of his special weaponry throughout the series. \"The final act is unrelenting and makes the first two-thirds of the novel seem like a walk in the park by comparison. I found the denouement to be satisfying and even a tad heart-wrenching.\" Since Orphan X was literally created by a black-ops government agency, he is programmed to live by a mission statement that includes numbered commandments. However, he is about to break one of them: Rule #4: Never make it personal. Evan never thought he would be tasked with finding and stopping a friend who has become a traitor. He will struggle like we have never seen before, and the likelihood of his success is impacted by this mission. Throughout NEMESIS, there is a secondary storyline involving Josephine \u201cJoey\u201d Morales as she is attempting to adapt to college life. Because, like Evan, she was not raised with the typical socialization skills of a normal person, this will not be easy for her. As much as I enjoy reading about Joey, I was distracted whenever she showed up as I was so eager to get back to Agent X and his intense narrative. Readers who have followed Evan's progress over the previous nine novels will recognize that he does not have many close friends. In fact, it could be said that Tommy is his only one, which makes reading this book a special treat. We get to see a different side of Evan, a more subdued and introspective version of the Nowhere Man who continuously battles his inner self over this unique, nightmarish mission. The final act is unrelenting and makes the first two-thirds of the novel seem like a walk in the park by comparison. I found the denouement to be satisfying and even a tad heart-wrenching. It is good to see characters like Evan --- who calls to mind other lone-wolf protagonists like Lee Child's Jack Reacher, Brad Thor's Scot Harvath, and Reed Farrel Coleman's Nick Ryan --- actually exhibit their human side. That distinction makes NEMESIS a truly memorable read. Reviewed by Ray Palen on February 14, 2025",

Perfect for readers of Brit Bennett and Tayari Jones. Two women. Two pivotal moments. One dream for justice and equality. In the fall of 1959, Freda Gilroy arrives on the campus of Fisk University full of hope, carrying a suitcase and the voice of her father telling her she\u2019s part of a family legacy of greatness. Soon, the ugliness of the Jim Crow South intrudes, and she\u2019s thrust into a movement for social change. Freda is reluctant to get involved, torn between a soon-to-be doctor her parents approve of and an audacious young man willing to risk it all in the name of justice. Freda finds herself caught between two worlds, and two loves, and must decide how much she\u2019s willing to sacrifice for the advancement of her people. In 1992 Chicago, Freda\u2019s daughter, Tulip, is an ambitious PR professional on track for an exciting career, if workplace politics and racial microaggressions don\u2019t get in her way. But with the ruling in the Rodney King trial weighing heavily on her, Tulip feels called to action. When she makes an irreversible professional misstep as she seeks to uplift her community, she must decide, just like her mother had three decades prior, what she\u2019s willing to risk in the name of justice and equality. Insightful, evocative and richly imagined with stories of hidden history, PEOPLE OF MEANS is an emotional tour de force that offers a glimpse into the quest for racial equality, the pursuit of personal and communal success, and the power of love and family ties.",

            "review": " No one writes historical thrillers quite like Steve Berry, and I continue to leave each of his novels feeling that much more aware of the secret history that exists in every corner of our wild world. THE MEDICI RETURN is no exception. Set in Siena, Italy, in 1512, the Prologue introduces us to a monetary debt entered into by the Vatican with the Medici family that was appropriately named \u201cPignus Christi,\u201d or Pledge of Christ. It has been over five centuries since anyone discussed this matter, but that is about to change thanks to Eric Casaburi. This driven man, who may be of Medici descent, believes that he is entitled to the trillions of dollars from the 16th-century pact with Pope Julius II, which will lead to government office and riches beyond his wildest dreams. \"THE MEDICI RETURN provides much to feast on when it comes to action and historical context. And, of course, adding Cotton Malone to the mix makes for one great reading experience.\" Enter our hero, Cotton Malone. The one-time government agent and current bookstore owner is still loyal to Stephanie Nelle, his former boss from the Magellan Billet, and rarely turns down an opportunity to assist her. Stephanie puts Cotton in touch with Cardinal Jason Richter, who is at the forefront of the activity involving the Vatican. The Pope is elderly and openly contemplating retirement. Hot for his seat at the next papal conclave is Sergio Cardinal Ascolani, who is no fan of Richter. In fact, Ascolani attempts to set up Richter by falsely accusing him of a shameful misdeed and banishing him to Germany, where he plans to have him eliminated. However, Richter is several steps ahead of Ascolani and never leaves Italy as he awaits Cotton\u2019s arrival. Ascolani already has met with Casaburi and intends to \u201ctake care\u201d of him as well, lest he mention some ancient unpleasantness that could threaten the entire papacy and his own run for the papal seat of honor. A great cast of characters flesh out this narrative, all of whom will converge in Florence before the action is over. One such individual is seasoned British assassin Thomas Dewberry, who has both Cotton and Richter listed among his next targets. Of course, he is in the employ of Ascolani, which makes the megalomaniacal Cardinal seem more like a Mafia don. Another character, Stefano of the Swiss Guard, ends up being a huge resource for Cotton and Richter as sides are drawn out in what is sure to be an epic battle. Some answers may lie in the ancient crypts, churches and libraries of Italy, and the first side to claim possession of some of these items in their scavenger hunt will be proclaimed the winner. When diving into a Steve Berry novel, I expect non-stop action that typically involves some intense globetrotting, along with moments that play to my love of world history. His books always contain some unknown historical mystery, and I enjoy learning about things I was never taught in school. THE MEDICI RETURN provides much to feast on when it comes to action and historical context. And, of course, adding Cotton Malone to the mix makes for one great reading experience. Berry\u2019s typical lengthy Writer\u2019s Note at the end of the novel is quite the treat for history buffs. It is so nice to marvel at his fertile imagination and tireless drive to discover new stories set in the arena of global history, which is the perfect impetus to explore them via his first-rate fiction.

            "review": " I love Marie Benedict\u2019s portraits of little-known or misunderstood female historical figures. THE QUEENS OF CRIME, a mystery within a mystery, is a profile of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers set during the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. When we meet Dorothy --- the creator of upper-class amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey --- she is joining Agatha for tea. Though the two are peers in the crime fiction genre, she has an ulterior motive for their meeting: an opportunity that she hopes Agatha won\u2019t shy away from, despite her recent brush with media notoriety after her 11-day disappearance in 1926. (Readers of Benedict no doubt will know all about this, having read THE MYSTERY OF MRS. CHRISTIE in 2020.) Dorothy has just joined forces with Gilbert Keith Chesterton to launch the Detection Club, soon to be the preeminent organization of mystery writers. In 1930s England, genre fiction (like mysteries and thrillers) is still considered low-brow, despite high demand from readers and notable sales. Banding together with Gilbert, Dorothy hopes to change the way crime fiction is perceived. Although they share a vision for the genre at large, they differ on one notable opinion: Gilbert thinks that two female members are enough --- more than enough, you might say --- while Dorothy believes that there are too many excellent women crime writers to stop the count at two. In her usual glass-ceiling-breaking way, Dorothy launches a plan. Along with Agatha, an accepted member, she will usher in several other popular fiction writers --- all women --- in the hopes that Gilbert will find their arrival too surprising to raise a fuss. Thus Baroness Emma Orczy, New Zealander Ngaio Marsh, and bright Margery Allingham also become members of the Detection Club. In name, at least. \"Equal parts historical fiction and compelling whodunit, THE QUEENS OF CRIME is Marie Benedict at her best, a lively takedown of the patriarchy backed by real-world examples and true grit.\" The male members remain uneager to welcome in their female compatriots, so sleuth-minded Dorothy crafts yet another scheme. If she and her female cohorts --- who call themselves the Queens of Crime --- really want to be accepted for their ingenuity and craft, penning the perfect or bestselling mystery is not enough. Instead, they\u2019ll need to solve a real-life crime to earn their spots at the table. It\u2019s a tall order for most, but Dorothy has a connection. Mac Fleming, Dorothy's husband and a reporter for News of the World, has just been asked to journey to Boulogne, France, to investigate the disappearance of May Daniels, a 21-year-old nurse from London. May and her friend, Cecilia, boarded a ferry to Boulogne, visited the shops, and ducked into a restroom before their return trip. Or at least that was the plan. Instead, May went to the ladies\u2019 room, Cecilia stood just outside, and May vanished into thin air. There were no alternate exits in the restroom, no suspects, and no indication of where May could have gone. It\u2019s a literal locked-room mystery that you typically only see in, well, an Agatha Christie novel. Therefore, who better to solve it than the same writers who made a name for the genre? Enter the Queens of Crime. Of course, 1930s England (and France, for that matter) is still a patriarchal era, so Dorothy and her fellow Queens will need to employ some serious subterfuge to kick off their investigation. While Dorothy accompanies Mac to Boulogne, the others follow along, with Dorothy planning to secretly meet with them each day after joining Mac at his police press conferences. On their very first day, the news breaks that May\u2019s body has been found near a park, just under a tree, with a syringe nearby. The press, including (disappointingly) Mac, is quick to capitalize on the scandal: a young nurse trekking to a foreign country in search of or selling drugs. Case closed. But to the skilled thriller writer (and, frankly, the even mediocre reader), the case is a tad too tidy. May is found with none of her effects save her wallet, which includes the ID needed to correctly identify her body despite months of decay. The syringe is a nice touch, but May boasts no scars or track marks (and Dorothy is quick to wonder why a nurse would need to go anywhere but her own job for a bit of morphine). In fact, she died of strangulation, yet her body sits atop a deep stain of blood. Pairing these lukewarm discoveries with Agatha\u2019s astute observation that women bleed for many reasons, the Queens of Crime land on a shared hunch: May was murdered, most likely by a man, and tidily so. This method suggests not just intent, but planning. As the Queens of Crime set out to recreate the last day, week and month of May\u2019s life, they continue to stumble upon clues and evidence either ignored by the police or written off as the inane gossiping of women. Each discovery unearths a new failing by the authorities, and each clue brings them closer to finding out what really happened to May. Soon the women realize that they no longer want to solve the crime for themselves. They want to do it for May, even though the media is quick to write her off as a \u201csurplus woman\u201d or whore. Although the women are skilled at plotting --- and therefore, unplotting --- mysteries, they are not trained detectives, and they soon find that their questioning has not gone unnoticed. When Dorothy is attacked one night in London and her biggest secret is threatened, the women know that they\u2019re on to something --- and that someone is on to them. Can the biggest names in crime fiction put their skills to the test in the real world, or should that be left to its \u201ckings\u201d? Well, if you don\u2019t know the answer, you clearly haven\u2019t read a Marie Benedict novel. Just as she did in THE MYSTERY OF MRS. CHRISTIE, Benedict immerses her readers in the Golden Age of Crime Fiction and the insular but welcoming world of mystery writers. Readers who frequent ThrillerFest or other thriller author events will know that this camaraderie runs deep. But Benedict really heightens the tension by exploring the roots of this connection, as well as all the ways that it once excluded marginalized writers. Pairing this history lesson with a riveting whodunit, she imagines the perfect mystery: mystery writers uncovering a mystery while hiding mysteries of their own. This combination is spellbinding, a surefire hit, yet Benedict is not content to rest on a strong premise alone. Instead, she crafts characters who live and breathe on the page --- employing their known histories, but also her own fictional flair --- to make every discovery, every clue and every red herring feel as immediate and real as the very book in your hands. In doing so, she carefully unpacks the misogyny of the genre\u2019s start, not to mention the perception of women in general, to remind readers that women have always been there and known a bit more than their male counterparts. Equal parts historical fiction and compelling whodunit, THE QUEENS OF CRIME is Marie Benedict at her best, a lively takedown of the patriarchy backed by real-world examples and true grit.

            "review": " If you like your mysteries and thrillers filled with gothic intrigue and just a touch of village paganism, then Laura McCluskey\u2019s THE WOLF TREE should be right up your alley. Eilean Eadar is a barren, windswept rock off the coast of Scotland with a small population of very secretive, suspicious inhabitants. Their claim to fame up until a recent tragedy was the disappearance of three lighthouse keepers in 1919. Now, at the base of that very same lighthouse, the body of a young man named Alan Ferguson is found and initially is written off as a suicide. \"THE WOLF TREE is a stunner of a debut novel that will keep you reading long into the night. Laura McCluskey knows how to get under the skin of readers and toes the line between mystery and horror in all the best ways.\" The actual investigation will be overseen by two detective inspectors from Glasgow: Georgina \u201cGeorge\u201d Lennox and her more senior partner, Richie Stewart. With most of the locals being less than hospitable and forthcoming, this will be an arduous task. For George, it is also her first time out in the field after a devastating accident that found her on leave from the force. Their main contact and guide also works as the town postmaster. Most of the residents of Eilean Eadar wear multiple hats. George and Richie are regaled with folklore about the lost lighthouse keepers and then shown the residence that they will inhabit for a week. They quickly realize that it is not a good idea to go outside after dark, so they limit their investigation to the daytime hours. When George and Richie speak with Alan\u2019s feisty mother, they are promptly joined by Father James Ross, who is more than a bit protective as he takes over the questioning. Eventually, a reason is given for Alan\u2019s alleged suicide (which I will not spoil here), though it\u2019s one that would be better suited for a gothic horror novel. It is George who first notices the wolf howls in the area, and her suspicions will get the best of her before their short stay is over. Having a nose for sniffing out the truth will take her to an area of the forest around the fabled Wolf Tree, where the deepest, darkest secrets of this haunting town lie. These are secrets that its residents may kill to keep from being revealed. THE WOLF TREE is a stunner of a debut novel that will have you reading long into the night. Laura McCluskey knows how to get under the skin of readers and toes the line between mystery and horror in all the best ways. Reviewed by Ray Palen on February 14, 2025",

            "review": " The opening scene of Anne Tyler\u2019s new novel, THREE DAYS IN JUNE, introduces us to Gail Baines, an assistant to the Headmistress at a private girls\u2019 school in Baltimore. Those of us who have read Tyler\u2019s work will feel like we already know Gail and some of the observations going through her mind. She holds herself back, and her interior commentary on the specifics of memory and what is happening contrasts with her calm, measured actions. The Headmistress taps the face of her wristwatch, and Gail is drawn back to the moment, recalling her father\u2019s tapping on his watch. Tyler connects the past and present with a few sentences, and we remember how gracefully she does that. \"Gail's story is beautifully told, showing quiet passion and acknowledging what her world has become and how she arrived there.\" We do not know the next piece, though. The Headmistress quickly says that she is retiring. But Gail will not assume her position as anticipated; instead, a dynamic young woman from Tennessee will take over. Gail walks out of the office, leaves the school and drives home. Home is a small, unassuming white house that Gail has lived in since her divorce years earlier. The three days in June, the three days that will become very important, now begin. Gail\u2019s only child, Debbie, is getting married this weekend, but Gail\u2019s involvement is minimal. Debbie picked out her wedding gown alone. Her mother-of-the-bride blue dress was one she had liked and worn a few times before, and all she had to do was pick it up at the cleaner\u2019s. Even the spa day for the bridal party, a Day of Beauty, was planned by the groom\u2019s mother, who did not bother to invite Gail. That was okay by Gail; she had never heard of days of beauty anyway. Gail\u2019s ex-husband, Max, arrives unexpectedly from the Eastern Shore and brings a homeless cat that he wonders if she might adopt. A cat? She cannot nurture a houseplant, so no to the cat. There\u2019s a rehearsal dinner that night, a quick trip to a bargain store to buy a reasonable wedding suit for Max on Saturday, and the wedding happens. Later in the evening in the parking garage, they realize that neither of them had said a proper goodbye to Debbie. Twisting around in the driver\u2019s seat, Max retrieves the ticket, pays the fee and reminds her of their wedding day. Gail\u2019s father had taken Max aside and said that anytime she did something that was completely baffling, he should come to him. He would explain it. Gail laughs. \u201cHe\u2019d have said I had always been difficult.\u201d The third day begins, and Max packs to go home. Gail invites him to lunch first, and it seems she has named the cat Celine --- although she does not like to call her name aloud just yet. The restaurant they choose is a nod back to their university days, and even quick taps on wristwatches are nostalgic. In THREE DAYS IN JUNE, Anne Tyler once again has opened the life of an outwardly held-back woman --- with no people skills, the Headmistress had told her --- to reveal the layers that she has put away for years. Gail's story is beautifully told, showing quiet passion and acknowledging what her world has become and how she arrived there. Reviewed by Jane T. Krebs on February 21, 2025",

A young man returns from residential school only to realize he no longer can communicate with his own parents. A grieving mother finds purpose and healing on the front lines as a water protector. And a nervous child dances in her first Mawi\u2019omi. The collection also includes the Indigenous Voices Award-winning and title story \u201cWaiting for the Long Night Moon.\u201d At times sad, sometimes disturbing but always redemptive, the stories in WAITING FOR THE LONG NIGHT MOON will remind you that where there is grief there is also joy, where there is trauma there is resilience and, most importantly, there is power.",

            "review": " As much as I know that Jojo Moyes has received critical and popular acclaim for her historical fiction, I have to admit that I most enjoy her novels that concern themselves with the present-day realities of women's lives. That's why I was so excited to pick up her latest book, WE ALL LIVE HERE. Fortunately, it more than satisfies. It's hard to know which element of Lila Kennedy's complicated life to focus on first. Heaven knows she herself wouldn't know where to start. There's her falling-apart house, for one thing, which she loved back when she and her husband bought it as a fixer-upper. But now that she has been left to deal with its myriad maintenance issues on her own, Lila is finding the iffy plumbing significantly less than charming. Her mild-mannered stepfather, Bill, has helped (kind of) by moving in to help her with childcare and cooking, but her daughters are about to stage an outright revolt if they have to eat another lentil loaf. Meanwhile, recently widowed Bill is still mourning the loss of Lila's mother, paying tribute to Francesca by hanging a risqu\u00e9 painting in the living room and hiring a gardener to dig up the backyard and develop it into a memorial garden for her. \"In the end, as the title suggests, WE ALL LIVE HERE is an ode to a different kind of family --- one that is unexpected and impossible to contain, but in the end is something to embrace with all your heart.\" As for Lila's career, that's also in shambles. A full-time writer, she became the laughingstock of the publishing world --- and the local elementary school parents --- when, in the wake of her last book of relationship advice, her husband left her for Marja, another parent at the school. Now the two of them are madly in love, living in a spotless, minimalist house that's the polar opposite of Lila's ramshackle Victorian. And she's heard through the grapevine that they're expecting a baby of their own. Is it any wonder that Lila can't quite respond to her agent's increasingly insistent requests for a few chapters from her new book --- on how to thrive as a suddenly single (but still relentlessly sexy) person in your early 40s? Oh, and did I mention that Lila has been \"volun-told\" that she is to oversee the costumes for the elementary school production of Peter Pan? So when Lila's long-estranged father, Gene, arrives on her doorstep for a brief stay, and then can't quite bring himself to leave, this may be the final straw. Gene is a washed-up actor who had one hit show back when Lila was young. But then he ruined both his relationship with Lila and his marriage to Francesca by being unfaithful, inattentive and altogether unreliable. Even so, he's a larger-than-life kind of guy who has a way of sucking up all the oxygen in the place --- just when Lila barely feels like she can catch her own breath. As you're probably gathering, there's a LOT going on in WE ALL LIVE HERE, but in this case, that's a very good thing. Moyes adeptly brings together so many different primary and secondary characters and plot strands (even more than I've mentioned here!) that reading the book feels, in a way, like navigating Lila's own life: complicated, messy and difficult to pin down, but also filled with elements of humor, joy and discovery. Lila makes mistakes, misreads people, and even --- in one particularly wrenching situation --- makes poor and selfish choices that hurt people. But she also is resilient and loyal to the people she loves, and she genuinely tries to do the right thing. It's just that it's hard to see the way clearly when there are so many competing things blocking her view. Although Lila is the central figure for most of the novel, her older daughter, Celie, takes the reins at a couple of key moments in the narrative, offering an observer's view on Lila's parenting style as well as insights into Celie's largely (to Lila) inscrutable life and glimpses of a different side of Gene. Celie also steals the show, in a manner of speaking, near the end of the story. Who would have thought that one of the novel's biggest tear-jerking moments should take place at a school play? In the end, as the title suggests, WE ALL LIVE HERE is an ode to a different kind of family --- one that is unexpected and impossible to contain, but in the end is something to embrace with all your heart.

            "review": " Tova Mirvis asks just how far a family would go to protect their own in WE WOULD NEVER, a riveting literary page-turner. When a contentious divorce, an estranged adult son and a debilitating illness all come for the Marcuses, they must decide who among them is strong enough to say \u201cEnough.\u201d Although the warning signs have been there for months, Hailey Gelman is shocked when her husband, Jonah, asks her for a divorce. He\u2019s been miserable for some time, and there\u2019s one irreconcilable issue in their marriage that he only sees getting worse: her well-meaning but intrusive family, namely her mother, Sherry. Hailey knows that Sherry can be a bit overbearing. But she\u2019s also aware that her mother\u2019s more suffocating tendencies come not from a desire to control, but from a deep well of love for her, as well as her brothers, Nate and Adam. Along with her daughter, Maya, Hailey flees the home she shares with Jonah in New York to her parents\u2019 place in Palm Beach, where she can regroup, recover and pretend (even for a moment) that her life isn\u2019t imploding. \"Propulsive in its tone, ambitious in its probing of the human psyche, and full of poignant questions about morality and love, WE WOULD NEVER is a must-read.\" But with Palm Beach comes a return to the Marcus family, whose motto is that they would \u201cdo anything for each other.\u201d Despite the saccharine sweetness of the saying, Sherry\u2019s fanatic clinging to it has not smoothed over any family rifts, but rather intensified them, with deep-seated hurts and betrayals being ignored and left to fester rather than be addressed. The most obvious evidence of this is Adam, who has not spoken to the family since Hailey\u2019s wedding, when a tragedy splintered the already tenuous bond that he shared with them, especially his mother. Not quite as obvious, but no less painful, is the tension between Nate and their father, Solomon. Although the two work together at the family dermatology practice, Solomon is either unwilling or unable to shed his long-standing opinion of Nate as a screw-up, who is more keen on practical jokes and poking bears than being reliable or dependable. All of this would be enough to sink even a functional family, but Sherry is confident that the Marcuses can get through anything, especially now that her daughter is home. Tired of being an empty-nester, she can find some real purpose again. But then the unthinkable happens. Hailey receives a call from the police informing her that her estranged husband, soon-to-be ex, and star of their growing-ever-more-contentious divorce has been shot and killed in the doorway to his home. If you\u2019ve read just one thriller or watched an episode of any police procedural, you know as well as Hailey does that she\u2019s the obvious suspect. Although she has an airtight alibi, the divorce proceedings, Jonah\u2019s frequent mutterings about her family\u2019s control over her, and her mother\u2019s pushiness combine to paint a portrait of her that even she doesn\u2019t recognize. Eventually, Hailey must wonder if she somehow caused Jonah\u2019s death. After all, she can\u2019t deny ever wishing for it. It\u2019s no spoiler to say that Hailey is not responsible for what happened, but that statement is not so simple, either. Alternating between the months leading up to Jonah\u2019s murder, the tragic days that follow, and five months later --- when Hailey finally has the chance to analyze it all --- Tova Mirvis pens a riveting domestic drama about the most complicated, painful and love-filled thing of all: family. Although Hailey is our ostensible protagonist, Mirvis draws the most compelling portrait of Sherry. Through Sherry\u2019s eyes, we see her perspective of herself: a loving mother who even now remains stunned that she, a former lonely only child, was able to manifest a family so rich in flavor and love. We also see her fierce devotion to her children, particularly Hailey, and how she thinks only of their safety and happiness, often to her own detriment. Through the eyes of her children, however, a slightly skewed reflection appears: Sherry is toxically positive, always exclaiming about how happy she and her family are, even when all evidence is to the contrary. Rather than actually addressing issues in her family --- the start of Adam\u2019s estrangement, Nate\u2019s inability to impress his father, even Hailey\u2019s people-pleasing tendencies --- she prefers to gloss over them with a hug and a smile, empty gestures that she sees as icons. So laser-focused is she on her children that she often misses the signs of other issues, like Solomon\u2019s health. Sherry is complicated and complex, multilayered in the way that only the most gifted, emotionally intelligent authors can achieve. Without demonizing or villainizing her, Mirvis highlights the darkest, most vicious corners of Sherry\u2019s mind and asks readers, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you feel the same?\u201d So how can a family beset by so many painful, ongoing tragedies cope? And what would they do to stop the drama and the pain? As Mirvis shows, it\u2019s true that we can never really know another person, but it\u2019s even more shocking how frequently we learn that we don\u2019t even know ourselves. The gap between imagining something and doing it is infinitesimally small, and with just one decision, you can find yourself doing something you would never do. While not exactly a thriller --- the focus is less on identifying the killer and more on how each of the Marcus family members react to the murder --- the book has all the trademarks of one: edge-of-your seat suspense, hidden motives and alliances, and, of course, death. Propulsive in its tone, ambitious in its probing of the human psyche, and full of poignant questions about morality and love, WE WOULD NEVER is a must-read.

            "review": " James Rollins, long-renowned for his outstanding and well-researched thrillers, has proven that he is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to fantasies. A DRAGON OF BLACK GLASS continues the adventures previously covered in THE STARLESS CROWN and THE CRADLE OF ICE. The greatest twist that Rollins throws at readers is that this stellar series is not a trilogy. He freely indicates that the finale will take place with the 2026 release of the fourth novel. As with the earlier books, A DRAGON OF BLACK GLASS includes a much-needed \u201cCast of Characters\u201d list that spans four-and-a-half pages. I found myself constantly flipping back to it during the course of my reading. \"Much is left open-ended in A DRAGON OF BLACK GLASS, but those who have been along for the ride will feel excited to finally get closure to this epic and enjoyable adventure.\" Rollins has put these books under the umbrella of the Moonfall Saga as all of the events here are punctuated by the idea that the moon may be literally crashing into the Urth, essentially wiping out all living beings, if not utterly destroying the planet. Our young heroine, Nyx, must find an ancient weapon that may not even exist in an attempt to save everyone. According to the legend, across the part of the planet that is completely ice-blasted and uninhabitable lies a weapon of \u201cglass\u201d buried beneath the frozen tundra. Nyx is aboard a ship and opens the story flying aboard a winged giant bat named Bashaliia. The oncoming moonfall event is fully on her mind, and even though she does not trust all those traveling with her, she remains determined to prevent this from happening. She also still must deal with enemy factions on land that belongs to the residents of the Western Crown. Rollins has done a nice bit of worldbuilding with the Moonfall Saga, and it is necessary to read these books in order so you can get the complete experience. Much of the novel deals with the war that is breaking out across the Crown, a narrative that is carried simultaneously to Nyx, and companies trek to the frozen wasteland in search of the fabled ancient weapon that could end the war, as well as their planet\u2019s destruction. Nyx also must wage an inner battle as her specialized gift --- called bridle-song --- opens her up to certain dark elements that threaten to take over her soul. Whereas Prince Kanthe from the Crown recognizes that he must destroy all he loves to save the world, Nyx is on an entirely different and more inclusionary path whereby she could become the savior of all beings. Meanwhile, the cunning weapon hidden deep in the ground has the capability of either saving or ending all life. If Nyx should find it, will she prove to be a friend or a foe in the face of such power? Much is left open-ended in A DRAGON OF BLACK GLASS, but those who have been along for the ride will feel excited to finally get closure to this epic and enjoyable adventure.

            "review": " It\u2019s hard to believe that a Hall of Famer actually was a second fiddle during a good chunk of his career. But Don Drysdale, an imposing 6\u20195\u201d hard-throwing righty, had the \u201cmisfortune\u201d of pitching on the same staff as Sandy Koufax. Veteran journalist Mark Whicker looks to give \u201cBig D\u201d his due in DON DRYSDALE: UP AND IN. Drysdale grew up in California but was signed by the Dodgers while they were still in Brooklyn. In fact, when he retired in 1969 at the age of 32 --- just two years older than Koufax, who was forced to step down after the 1966 season because of injuries --- he was the last player from those \u201cBoys of Summer\u201d teams. \"Veteran journalist Mark Whicker looks to give 'Big D' his due in DON DRYSDALE: UP AND IN.... As intimidating a presence as he was, Whicker wants readers to know that Drysdale had a kinder, gentler side.\" It might be unfathomable for younger fans to imagine a time when starting pitchers routinely pitched more than 250 innings a year. In fact, Drysdale had four consecutive seasons of more than 300 innings. He also was famous (or infamous) for throwing at batters, especially those who chose to challenge him by standing close to the plate. As intimidating a presence as he was, Whicker wants readers to know that Drysdale had a kinder, gentler side. He was among the first to welcome rookies to the team, which was uncommon for veterans in those days. And while he might knock you down with an up-and-in pitch, after the game he would buy you a beer. Let bygones be bygones. There are two events that stand out in Drysdale\u2019s career, aside from eight All-Star appearances and a Cy Young Award, indicative of the league\u2019s best pitcher. Prior to the 1966 season, he and Koufax took the unheard-of stance of joint contract negotiations. This was several years before free agency when teams still controlled the fates of their players. Koufax and Drysdale wanted a staggering sum of $1 million split between the two of them over three years and were prepared to hold out if their demands were not met. Although Drysdale and Koufax didn\u2019t get all that money, they did get hefty raises, both receiving more than $100,000. (Koufax would step down after the Dodgers lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series that year.) What would they have done if the Dodgers didn\u2019t play ball? Perhaps acting would fill the void. Drysdale appeared in several TV shows, including \u201cThe Flying Nun,\u201d \u201cThe Brady Bunch,\u201d \u201cThe Greatest American Hero\u201d and \u201cThen Came Bronson.\u201d The second major accomplishment was breaking the record for consecutive scoreless innings, which occurred in 1968, known as \u201cthe year of the pitcher.\u201d Drysdale did not allow a run to score for more than 58 innings, a number that was broken by another Dodger hurler, Orel Hershiser, with 59 in 1988. Despite his stats, Drysdale was not a shoe-in for the Hall of Fame. While he eventually was inducted in 1988, it took him 14 years to make it to Cooperstown. After Drysdale retired, he became a broadcaster. He worked for several teams, including the Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, Texas Rangers, California Angels and Montreal Expos. In 1993, while working a game for the Dodgers against the Expos, Drysdale was found dead in his hotel in Montreal. He was just 59 years old. As for his life off the field, Drysdale was married twice, the second time to basketball legend Ann Meyers. He enjoyed good music and good booze, which Whicker suggests may have been a problem. Drysdale was involved in a DUI accident that cost him in fines and community service, but it never seemed to interfere with his vocation. While it\u2019s good to have Drysdale\u2019s story told, UP AND IN does have a few flaws. In 1965, Koufax sat out of the first game of the World Series against the Minnesota Twins because it fell on Yom Kippur, which Whicker fails to explain is the most solemn day on the Jewish calendar. Perhaps he thinks everyone knows that. Another faux pas is suggesting that one can buy tickets to the Hall of Fame on Ticketmaster. One cannot.

Charlie has asked Garrett, his best friend from college, to officiate the ceremony, though Cece can\u2019t imagine anyone more ill-suited for the task --- an airport baggage handler haunted by a tragedy from his and Charlie\u2019s shared past. But as Cece spends time with Garrett, his gruff mask slips, and she grows increasingly uncertain about her future. And why does Garrett, after meeting Cece, begin to feel, well, human again? As a contagious stomach flu threatens to scuttle the wedding, and Charlie and Garrett\u2019s friendship is put to the ultimate test, Cece must decide between the life she\u2019s dreamed of and a life she\u2019s never imagined.

Spanning 50 years and set against the backdrop of a rapidly warming Montana, DREAM STATE explores what it means to live with the mistakes of the past --- both our own and the ones we\u2019ve inherited. Written with humor, precision and enormous heart, both a love letter and an elegy to the American West, DREAM STATE is a thrillingly ambitious ode to the power of friendship, the weird weather of marriage, and the beauty of impermanence.",

            "review": " Rebecca Romney, a rare book collector and Jane Austen enthusiast, has given the world an answer to this question: \u201cIf all our bookshelves are full of Jane Austen books, what filled her own shelves so long ago?\u201d She discovered a variety of female writers who themselves were responsible for inspiring Austen to pick up her pen again and again. JANE AUSTEN\u2019S BOOKSHELF is a real eye opener, a valiant and entertaining effort to ensure that these women do not get lost in the literary canon shuffle anymore. From the BookTok girlies to the PhD candidates, every Austen fan will find here a wondrous and enjoyable historical journey to the heart of literary feminism, as well as some clues about how the rare books world works. Romney has a delightful voice; she is self-effacing, funny and quite knowledgeable. As she moves forward on her quest, readers will do the easy part --- sit back, relax, enjoy the biographies of these fantastic women and their works, and then pick up a copy of every single volume that Romney mentions for further reading heaven. \"I certainly expect that Romney\u2019s excellent cultivation of [these writers'] life stories in JANE AUSTEN\u2019S BOOKSHELF will build a new interest and understanding for the readers of today and the books of yesterday.\" Romney uncovers eight writers who most likely will not be known beyond academic circles but whose output was on par with Austen\u2019s relatable works: Frances Burney, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Lennox, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, Elizabeth Inchbald, Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi and Maria Edgeworth. She starts her hunt by asking herself where the term \u201cpride and prejudice\u201d came from, revealing an answer that surprised her. It originated from Burney\u2019s novel, CECILIA, one of the most famous books of Austen\u2019s lifetime. In this era, more women published novels than men. However, if we were to follow general readership trends, we would see that no real dent was made in the canon by these authors. Romney\u2019s work will change that in a significant way. Austen was a productive reader who owned as many of the books she read as possible. There is the sense of a deep passion here, not just between Romney and Austen\u2019s love for female-driven plotlines, but for the joy of holding in one\u2019s hand a beautiful book, full of the possibility of a literary journey that takes one away from the real-world issues every era creates. Romney gives ample space to each author here, whether she is a playwright, a poet or a novelist. These works were both commercially viable and artistically explorative, but they have been forgotten in the midst of all the attention given to Austen\u2019s enduring classics. As an English major considering a PhD in literature, I have to say that I was flummoxed by how few of these writers are acknowledged by academics or even in the Bookstagram posts of the most deep-cutting creators. I certainly expect that Romney\u2019s excellent cultivation of their life stories in JANE AUSTEN\u2019S BOOKSHELF will build a new interest and understanding for the readers of today and the books of yesterday.

            "review": " I\u2019m writing this review on the morning after viewing the more than three hours of the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary special, a delightful evening that revealed many of the strengths (and a few of the weaknesses) of this storied television franchise. As someone who watched the program\u2019s debut on October 11, 1975 from my apartment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and regularly since that time, I\u2019m well-equipped to appreciate Susan Morrison\u2019s LORNE: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live, a biography that\u2019s both enlightening and entertaining. Morrison, the articles editor of The New Yorker, approached Michaels about the project in 2015, and the detail that unfurls in the book\u2019s 600 pages is a testament to her commitment to her task and the depth of her research. She also has at least a remote connection to Michaels\u2019 career, having worked as an assistant to longtime \u201cSNL\u201d writer Jim Downey on \u201cThe New Show,\u201d a Friday night spinoff that ran for a few months in 1984. While Morrison doesn\u2019t airbrush Michaels\u2019 shortcomings, she admits that he \u201cgenerously opened the door\u201d to her, and she responds in a spirit that is undeniably warm and sympathetic. The book proceeds on parallel tracks. Each of its six parts leads off with an insider view of the making of an \u201cSNL\u201d episode --- in this case the one that aired on November 3, 2018, hosted by Jonah Hill, which earned him a coveted spot in the Five-Timers Club, along with luminaries like Tom Hanks, Steve Martin and Tina Fey. (Alec Baldwin currently holds the record at 17 host appearances.) \"...a biography that\u2019s both enlightening and entertaining.... The balance of LORNE is a well-rounded portrait of its subject... Morrison dutifully chronicles the many ups and fewer downs of 'SNL' over its 50-year run...\" Anyone reading Morrison\u2019s account --- comprising roughly 20 percent of the book --- will be impressed (and perhaps slightly bemused) at how a process that begins anew each week with the writers\u2019 meeting on Monday somehow manages to culminate with the airing of a mostly live show six days later for 20 new episodes each season. By the end of the dress rehearsal that concludes at around 10pm on Saturday, the show typically runs 20-30 minutes long, and Michaels skillfully (and, of necessity, ruthlessly) orders cuts even as it airs. Along the way, he must manage the idiosyncratic talents and sometimes clashing egos of the people who deliver it to its audience. The balance of LORNE is a well-rounded portrait of its subject --- born Lorne Lipowitz (he changed his name in 1967) to a middle-class Jewish family in Toronto (his Canadianness represents a subtle but important part of his identity) that wanted him to attend law school. As Morrison describes it, the sudden death of Michaels\u2019 father at age 50, when he was 14, was one of the defining events in his life. Morrison devotes ample attention to the roots of Michaels\u2019 career as it moved from his partnership with fellow Canadian Hart Pomerantz (the two once wrote jokes for Woody Allen and Joan Rivers and hosted a show --- \u201cThe Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour\u201d --- that ran on the CBC and was heavily influenced by the work of \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus\u201d) to Hollywood. There, Michaels developed his skills as a comedy writer on shows that included \u201cLaugh-In\u201d and Lily Tomlin comedy specials, all the while sharpening his vision for the project that became \u201cSNL.\u201d As Morrison explains, it was always Michaels\u2019 dream to produce films, which he was able to realize in 1992 --- only long after \u201cSNL\u201d became an established success --- with the production of Wayne\u2019s World. But alongside that ambition, he wanted to produce a show that departed from what he saw as the stale format of popular network variety programs and embodied the counterculture sensibility of his generation. With the occasionally problematic support of NBC executive Dick Ebersol and the enthusiastic backing of NBC president Herb Schlosser, Michaels got that chance in the spring of 1975. Morrison dutifully chronicles the many ups and fewer downs of \u201cSNL\u201d over its 50-year run (Michaels stepped away from it between 1980 and 1985). Loyal fans all have their view of the show\u2019s golden age, and while it would be impossible over the course of more than 900 episodes not to produce his share of duds, Michaels has been the consistent, usually unflappable, presence who ensures that overall standard remains high. One of his great gifts, in addition to a keen eye for on-air talent and, of equal or greater importance, great comic writing, has been his ability to reinvent the show while maintaining its essential formula. He likens its familiarity to a \u201cSnickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate.\u201d It\u2019s a recipe that has produced 103 Emmys in 50 years. But as Michaels likes to say, \u201cThe problem with making it look easy is that then people think it\u2019s easy.\u201d Michaels celebrated his 80th birthday in November 2024. With houses in Amagansett, Long Island, St. Barts and 5,000 acres in Maine, where he cultivates organic blueberries, it would be easy to imagine him marking 50 years of \u201cSNL\u201d by signing off the air and entering a well-deserved retirement. In a recent profile, however, Maureen Dowd of the New York Times reported that, despite identifying some potential successors, \u201cthe reigning king is not currently considering abdicating.\u201d That\u2019s good news for longtime fans of the show like me, but that day inevitably will come. When it does, for all the reasons Susan Morrison makes clear, he\u2019ll be assured an enduring place in entertainment history. Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg on February 21, 2025",

            "review": " In an afterword to NESTING, debut novelist Rois\u00edn O'Donnell (who has a prior well-regarded collection of short fiction) explains that the book\u2019s origins reside in an assignment she received to write a 3,000-word piece on the topic of \"Independence.\" Her research led to the discovery of the extent of Ireland's housing crisis and its impact on women and children. O'Donnell probably could have expanded that research and done a deep investigative dive. Fortunately, she decided to use her creative talents to pen a novel that introduces many of these issues while also making them achingly real for the characters she creates. Ciara Fay lives in a Dublin suburb with her husband, Ryan, and their two young daughters, Sophie and Ella. We later learn that Ciara had quite an adventurous youth. Although her family is Irish, she grew up in Sheffield, England, where her mother and sister still live. As a young woman, before she met Ryan and quickly got married, she traveled around the world teaching English as a second language, which she loved doing. She also was in the process of getting her primary teaching certification when she met Ryan, who promptly convinced her to give up that ambition as soon as they got married. \"O'Donnell's novel may inspire American readers to discuss the similarities and differences between the housing crises in the US and Ireland, and to consider how Ciara's situation might have played out differently if she was in the States.\" However, when readers meet Ciara, little of that vivacious young woman is left. Instead, she is isolated, lonely and fearful. Ryan gradually cuts her off from all other relationships, and he is a master manipulator, alternating between threatening her and wheedling her. He keeps a close eye on her money, accusing her of stealing if any cash goes unaccounted for, and he has unrealistic expectations about how their house and the children should be cared for. But, of course, he refuses to do any of the work himself. Ciara is constantly anxious and afraid --- and when she discovers that she's expecting another baby, she knows she needs to escape or risk never being able to do so. Ciara had attempted to leave once previously, when Ella was a tiny baby, but Ryan managed to coax her back home again. This time, though, she is determined. And as NESTING progresses, she constantly must reassert that determination. Ryan blocks the children's passports so she can't take them to her relatives' homes in the UK. He also sends her countless text messages as he threatens to take her to court to claim full custody of their children. Ciara has almost no money of her own, and she quickly discovers the limits of social services to help her. For better or for worse, she and the girls manage to find a placement on the floor of a Dublin hotel that's been set aside for unhoused families. Her troubles are far from over, but she does start to rediscover a social support network, not to mention the tiniest glimmers of independence, especially when she is able to get a teaching job at a language school and finally earn at least a little money of her own once again. The novel's title is apt. Throughout O'Donnell's expertly plotted story (readers constantly will be on edge about whether Ciara can maintain her courage rather than retreat to the material comforts of Ryan's home), Ciara demonstrates not only fierce love for her children but also the equally fierce desire to create a home for them, wherever they are. One of the most touching scenes takes place at Christmas, when Ciara sneaks back into her old house to claim the holiday decorations and then uses them to create a massive display of lights and glitter throughout the fifth floor of the hotel, a \"quiet, tinsel-fueled rebellion.\" The book also shows the insidious techniques of the emotionally abusive partner. Seeing how Ryan's wildly inconsistent behavior and manipulations fuel Ciara's self-doubt and erode her defenses is both maddening and entirely believable. Readers will be passionately rooting for Ciara to make it, and for her little family to come through this tumultuous time stronger and more united than ever. O'Donnell's novel may inspire American readers to discuss the similarities and differences between the housing crises in the US and Ireland, and to consider how Ciara's situation might have played out differently if she was in the States. For one thing, when one of Ciara's children develops a serious illness, she's able to take her to the hospital without any hesitation or stress about the financial toll it will take. NESTING puts a profoundly human face on an increasingly urgent issue. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on February 21, 2025",

The year is 1986. The city is San Francisco. Here, Martin Hench will invent the forensic accountant --- what a bounty hunter is to people, he is to money --- but for now he's an MIT dropout odd-jobbing his way around a city still reeling from the invention of a revolutionary new technology that will change everything about crime forever, one we now take completely for granted. When Marty finds himself hired by Silicon Valley PC startup Fidelity Computing to investigate a group of disgruntled ex-employees who've founded a competitor startup, he quickly realizes he's on the wrong side. Marty ditches the greasy old guys running Fidelity Computing without a second thought, utterly infatuated with the electric atmosphere of Computing Freedom. Located in the heart of the Mission, this group of brilliant young women found themselves exhausted by the predatory business practices of Fidelity Computing and set out to beat them at their own game, making better computers and driving Fidelity Computing out of business. But this optimistic startup, fueled by young love and California-style burritos, has no idea the depth of the evil they're seeking to unroot or the risks they run. In this company-eat-company city, Martin and his friends will be lucky to escape with their lives.",

We visit a quiet library in the vicinity of St. Paul and meet the forty-something librarian who has been nicknamed \u201csweater lady\u201d because she is never seen without her long-sleeve cardigans in the workplace. She is Hana Babic, but that is not her real name. When a man calling himself David Claypool pays her a visit at work, it will not only change her entire world but bring back a past she had hoped would remain hidden. \"Allen Eskens is such a gifted writer, and all of his books succeed at doing their part in explaining the human condition through authentic characters whose feelings ring true. THE QUIET LIBRARIAN is no exception...\" Claypool is a police detective, and he is seeking out Hana because she was listed as the only close friend to Amina, who regrettably has been found dead. Foul play is suspected as it appears she was tied up in her home and somehow got free, only to fall to her death from her own balcony. Neighbors reported seeing a man there shortly after this tragic incident. Her grandson, Dylan, was on his way home from school as Amina was his sole guardian after his mother\u2019s untimely passing. Not only does Detective Claypool want to get some answers from Hana about her deceased friend, he also must inform her that she was named as Dylan\u2019s new guardian in Amina\u2019s will. This narrative is interspliced with chapters set in the far past in Bosnia. It begins with Hana\u2019s birth in 1977. Born Nura Divjak, she lives with her parents and younger brother. Unfortunately, as we approach the early 1990s, the horrors of the Bosnian Serbian War reach even their mountain hideaway, and the fact that they\u2019re Muslim makes them targets for death at the hands of their enemies. Rumor has it that the female Muslims who are captured are subjected to rape and torture before losing their lives. Nura is brought directly back to the worst moment of her life when she witnesses her entire family murdered as she hides in a crawlspace of the home that would be burned to the ground. She escapes, but not before sustaining terrible burns that will forever scar her arms. She never forgets the men who savagely killed her loved ones --- including the rape and murder of her mother in their kitchen --- and vows to die getting her revenge. We get to experience what happens next to Nura in a progressive narrative that finds her teaming up with some rebel soldiers on her side. She satisfies her promise and, while briefly caught by enemies, bonds with another captured woman. Amina becomes her companion in an escape to the United States and the opportunity for a new life. Because Nura is still wanted for crimes against the state in Bosnia, she knows she can never return and instead becomes Hana Babic, a quiet Minnesota librarian. When Claypool informs Hana that the man who may have murdered Amina goes by the name Iblis (or \u201cdevil\u201d in their language), it hits Hana hard as she remembers killing Iblis during the war. Now, saddled with Dylan and knowing that there is a killer with vengeance on his mind who most certainly is looking for her, Hana must gear up for a return to her old self and attempt to stop this individual before he can get a jump on her. Allen Eskens is such a gifted writer, and all of his books succeed at doing their part in explaining the human condition through authentic characters whose feelings ring true. THE QUIET LIBRARIAN is no exception and uses the horrors of war as a backdrop for readers to submit to a deeply layered tale of grief and pain. Most of his novels utilize his home state of Minnesota as a setting, and switching off between there and Bosnia lends additional credibility to a story that you will not soon forget.

She has lived a modest life in Mason Hall, a rural Jamaican village, educating herself with stolen books, raising her two children, surviving by becoming a successful ganja farmer in the area, and experiencing both deep passion and true loss with her beloved baby father, Clive. Behind this seemingly benign fa\u00e7ade, however, Miss Pauline has buried many secrets. To avenge her enslaved ancestors, she has built her house, stone by stone, from the ruins of a plantation on her land. And she knows more than she has told about the disappearance of Turner Buchanan --- a white American man who came to Mason Hall decades ago to claim her land. The whispering stones, Miss Pauline realizes, are telling her that she must make peace with the past before she dies. With help from her American granddaughter, Justine, and Lamont, a teenager she enlists to help her navigate the mysteries of the Internet, she searches for those she has wronged. But as the people and stories of her past come to invade her present, she discovers that there are shocking secrets even she could not have anticipated.

And yet, now at the height of his fame, he teeters on the cusp of adulthood, his future uncertain. Often, he wishes he could stop time and remain a boy forever. Joan Buckler, Sander\u2019s best friend, also has a dream. Though unschooled, she is whip-smart and fascinated by the snippets of natural philosophy to which she\u2019s been exposed. And while she senses that Sander\u2019s admiration for her is more than mere friendship, Joan\u2019s true passion is knowledge, something that is nearly impossible for her to attain. As a woman, she has no place in the intellectual salons and cultural community of the day; only in disguise can she learn to her heart\u2019s content. Joan\u2019s covert intellectual endeavors, coupled with Sander\u2019s theatrical triumphs, attract the attention of none other than Francis Bacon: natural philosopher and trusted adviser to Queen Elizabeth. It is through their connection with Bacon --- one of the greatest minds of their time --- that their lives will be changed forever as they become embroiled in an intricate game of political intrigue that threatens their very survival. Brimming with heart, curiosity and rich historical detail, BOY offers an intimate glimpse of the moral complexities of a singular artistic era, and the roles we all choose to play on the world\u2019s stage.",

            "review": " When a husband asks his wife to consider what might be missing from their marriage, what follows surprises them both --- sex, heartbreak and heart rekindling, and a rediscovered sense of all that is possible. She\u2019s happy and settled and productive and content in her full life --- a child, a career, an admirable marriage, deep friendships, happy parents, and a spouse she still loves. But when her husband urges her to address what the narrow labels of \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife\u201d force them to edit out of their lives, the very best kind of hell breaks loose. Using Ada Calhoun\u2019s personal experiences as a jumping-off point, CRUSH is about the danger and liberation of chasing desire, the havoc it can wreak, and, most of all, the clear sense of self one finds when the storm passes. Destined to become a classic novel of marriage, and tackling the big questions being asked about partnership in postpandemic relationships, CRUSH is a sharp, funny, seductive and revelatory novel about holding on to everything it\u2019s possible to love --- friends, children, parents, passion, lovers, husbands, all of the world\u2019s good books, and, most of all, one\u2019s own deep sense of purpose.",

            "review": " From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of LILIANA'S INVINCIBLE SUMMER, a dreamlike, genre-defying novel about a professor and detective seeking justice in a world suffused with gendered violence. A city is always a cemetery. A professor named Cristina Rivera Garza stumbles upon the corpse of a mutilated man in a dark alley and reports it to the police. When shown a crime scene photo, she finds a stark warning written in tiny print with coral nail polish on the brick wall beside the body: \u201cBeware of me, my love / beware of the silent woman in the desert.\u201d The professor becomes the first informant on the case, which is led by a detective newly obsessed with poetry and trailed by a long list of failures. But what has the professor really seen? As the bodies of more castrated men are found alongside lines of verse, the detective tries to decipher the meaning of the poems to put a stop to the violence spreading throughout the city. Originally written in Spanish, where the word \u201cvictim\u201d is always feminine, DEATH TAKES ME is a thrilling masterpiece of literary fiction that flips the traditional crime narrative of gendered violence on its head. As sharp as the cuts on the bodies of the victims, it unfolds with the charged logic of a dream, moving from the police station to the professor\u2019s classroom and through the slippery worlds of Latin American poetry and art in an imaginative exploration of the unstable terrains of desire and sexuality.",

It\u2019s a Friday night in a campus bar in Berkeley, fall of 2000, and Percy Marks is pontificating about music again. Hall and Oates is on the jukebox, and Percy --- who has no talent for music, just lots of opinions about it --- can\u2019t stop herself from overanalyzing the song, indulging what she knows to be her most annoying habit. But something is different tonight. The guy beside her at the bar, fellow student Joe Morrow, is a songwriter. And he could listen to Percy talk all night. Joe asks Percy for feedback on one of his songs --- and the results kick off a partnership that will span years, ignite new passions in them both, and crush their egos again and again. Is their collaboration worth its cost? Or is it holding Percy back from finding her own voice? Moving from Brooklyn bars to San Francisco dance floors, DEEP CUTS examines the nature of talent, obsession, belonging and, above all, our need to be heard.",

            "review": " A thrilling reimagining of the world of Charles Dickens, as seen through the eyes of the infamous Jacob Fagin, London\u2019s most gifted pickpocket, liar and rogue. Long before Oliver Twist stumbled onto the scene, Jacob Fagin was scratching out a life for himself in the dark alleys of 19th-century London. Born in the Jewish enclave of Stepney shortly after his father was executed as a thief, Jacob's whole world is his open-minded mother, Leah. But Jacob\u2019s prospects are forever altered when a light-fingered pickpocket takes Jacob under his wing and teaches him a trade that pays far better than the neighborhood boys could possibly dream. Striking out on his own, Jacob familiarizes himself with London's highest value neighborhoods while forging his own path in the shadows. But everything changes when he adopts an aspiring teenage thief named Bill Sikes, whose mercurial temper poses a danger to himself and anyone foolish enough to cross him. Along the way, Jacob\u2019s found family expands to include his closest friend, Nancy, and his greatest prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the Artful Dodger. But as Bill\u2019s ambition soars and a major robbery goes awry, Jacob is forced to decide what he really stands for --- and what a life is worth. Colorfully written and wickedly funny, Allison Epstein breathes fresh life into the teeming streets of Dickensian London --- reclaiming one of Victorian literature\u2019s most notorious villains in an unforgettable new adventure.",

In \u201cA for Alone,\u201d a married artist embarks on a creative project intended to disprove the so-called Mike Pence Rule, which suggests that women and men can\u2019t spend time alone together without lusting after each other. And in \u201cLost but Not Forgotten,\u201d Sittenfeld gives readers of her novel PREP a window into the world of her beloved character Lee Fiora, decades later, when Lee attends an alumni reunion at her boarding school. Hilarious, thought-provoking and full of tenderness for her characters, Sittenfeld\u2019s stories peel back layer after layer of our inner lives, keeping us riveted to the page with her utterly distinctive voice.",

When they married Emperors Franz Joseph and Napoleon III, respectively, Elisabeth of Austria and Eug\u00e9nie of France became two of the most famous women on the planet. Not only were they both young and beautiful --- becoming cultural and fashion icons of their time --- but they played a pivotal role in ruling their realms during a tempestuous era characterized by unprecedented political and technological change. Fearless, adventurous and independent, Elisabeth and Eug\u00e9nie represented a new kind of empress --- one who rebelled against tradition and anticipated and embraced modern values. Yet both women endured hardship in their private and public lives. Elisabeth was plagued by a mother-in-law who snatched her infant children away and undermined her authority at court. Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s husband was an infamous philanderer who could not match the military prowess of his namesake. Between them, Elisabeth and Eug\u00e9nie were personally involved in every major international confrontation in their turbulent century, which witnessed thrilling technological advances, as well as revolutions, assassinations and wars. With her characteristic in-depth research and jump-off-the-page writing, Nancy Goldstone brings to life these two remarkable women, as Europe goes through the convulsions that led up to the international landscape we recognize today.",

            "review": " In this spellbinding and provocative novel from the New York Times bestselling author of THE AGE OF MIRACLES, a young mother is struck by sudden and puzzling psychological symptoms that illuminate the mysterious dimensions of the human mind --- and of love. A year after her child is born, Jane suffers a series of strange episodes: amnesia, premonitions, hallucinations and an inexplicable sense of dread. Three days after her first visit to a psychiatrist, Jane suddenly goes missing. A day later she is found unconscious in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park, in the midst of what seems to be an episode of dissociative fugue. When she comes to, she has no memory of what has happened to her. Are Jane\u2019s strange experiences the result of being overwhelmed by motherhood, or are they manifestations of a long-buried trauma from her past? Why is she having visions of a young man who died 20 years ago and who warns her of a disaster ahead? Jane\u2019s symptoms lead her psychiatrist ever deeper into the farthest reaches of her mind and cause him to question everything he thinks he knows about so-called reality --- including events in his own life. Karen Thompson Walker\u2019s profound and beautifully written novel is both a speculative mystery about memory, identity and fate, and a mesmerizing literary puzzle about the bonds of love --- between mother and child, between a man and a woman, and among those we\u2019ve lost but who may still be among us.",

            "review": " \"Hollywood Wives\" meets A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD in this emotional debut novel from Variety chief correspondent and a moderator of the \"Actors on Actors\" series about a group of actresses confronting their careers, their secrets and each other throughout one turbulent awards season. As Hollywood prepares for its most glamorous evening, five actresses compete to see who will claim the top prize. Adria, a dignified and highly regarded grand dame of the movie industry, is intent on cementing her legacy as one of the greatest thespians of all time, even as the younger generation creeps up quickly behind her. Bitty must keep a nervous breakdown --- and an increasingly debilitating alcohol addiction --- at bay as she searches for genuine closeness in an unforgiving landscape. Contessa, a former child star, is determined to make the world, and her leading man, take her seriously. Davina attempts to find her footing in superficial Los Angeles, a far cry from her roots as a serious London stage actress. And Jenny --- always the underdog to her rival, Adria --- sees this awards season as her personal redemption, a chance to atone for past mistakes and make up for missed opportunities. With humor, wit and an insider\u2019s insight, THE TALENT peels back the layers of women who are in the business of being perceived. And while they work to push their careers forward and maintain the public\u2019s goodwill, all five are forced to confront truths about themselves that they would rather ignore: Could Adria and Jenny have been a team all these years, rather than bitter enemies? Is it their responsibility to offer a lifeline to poor Bitty, who is clearly teetering on the edge? Should Contessa and Davina dim their own rising stars to make those around them more comfortable? What do women in the spotlight owe each other, and themselves?",

Clare is supposed to be the grown-up one. Married to the love of her life, with a major deal for her first novel, she has everything she thought she wanted. So then why does it all feel so wrong? When she agrees to a weeklong vacation with five of her oldest friends, she is hoping for an escape with the people who know her best. There is Jessie, who won\u2019t stop talking about her new boyfriend; Mac, trying to pretend he hasn\u2019t outgrown the group; Kyle, the eternal peacemaker; and Renzo, who brought them all together but keeps picking fights. And then, of course, there\u2019s Liam, the guy Clare barely has seen since high school but somehow can\u2019t get out of her head --- or her bed. But when a terrifying news alert shatters their peace, it becomes harder to ignore how much the world has changed since they were teenagers. As the resentments and tensions that have always simmered just beneath the surface begin to boil, Clare must ask if their shared history is enough to sustain their friendships, or if growing up might mean letting go. With crackling wit and emotional fearlessness, WHEN WE GROW UP is a provocative portrait of friendship in a world that feels ever more unrecognizable and a searing exploration of what it means to be a good person.",

            "review": " One might be tempted to look at the cover of THERE\u2019S SOMETHING ABOUT MIRA and think that Sonali Dev's latest novel is a rom-com. While there is plenty of romance in this very touching story that spans generations, states, continents, cultures and social status, there are also quite a few situations that force us to examine our own prejudices and misconceptions. Even in how we express ourselves, we often reveal our inner, often very unintentional microaggressions. Mira Salvi is a lovely young woman of Indian descent. By Indian standards (her parents\u2019 standards), she isn't really that young anymore. But she (finally) has gotten engaged to a perfectly wonderful man, Druv, and they are planning a huge Indian wedding --- four days, multiple wedding dresses, the whole shebang. Her conservative parents have worked hard for their success, and Mira didn't grow up privileged like the other Indian kids her age in her Chicago suburb. They have instilled in Mira the \"rules\" that she must behave, be perfect, and be the good Indian girl so she doesn\u2019t embarrass them. Mira has always complied, except once when the results were disastrous. \"The many pieces of the story come together perfectly at the end, satisfying our desire for a happily-ever-after and for wrongs to be righted. Not all of those wrongs are righted, but we'll take what we can get.\" But as much as Mira knows that she is lucky to have Druv, she holds back. She is still living with her parents, while her twin brother, Rumi, is in New York; they haven\u2019t seen or talked to each other in a long time. There also is a thinly veiled reference to something that happened to Mira in high school, and she hasn't shared anything personal with Druv, including her very mixed feelings about her parents and her brother. They have planned their engagement-moon, a kind of engagement honeymoon, to New York. Druv loves the city and wants to show her all his favorite places. Mira, on the other hand, loves watching romantic movies. In her mind, she can't wait to visit the Empire State Building where Deborah Kerr planned to meet Cary Grant in An Affair to Remember, and more recently where Meg Ryan decided to meet Tom Hanks in Sleepless in Seattle. But Druv can\u2019t make it because of work. He's a doctor, and his partner is injured, so he's needed in the practice. Mira doesn't want to cancel the trip as it's all paid for and nonrefundable. So when Druv suggests that she go alone, she jumps at the opportunity. Mira also wants to see Rumi and patch things up with him. She can't imagine getting married without her twin by her side, but she has to convince him to come. When Mira arrives in New York, we learn exactly why Rumi is estranged from their parents. There\u2019s definitely some magic in the air as Mira walks along Times Square toward the Empire State Building. Dev's writing perfectly demonstrates how Mira is feeling and at the same time showcases her love of movies as she muses, \"In my head Cary Grant smiles knowingly at me as I hop onto the sidewalk over a manhole\u2026. Meg Ryan tendrils of hair dance around my face as I walk and walk, skipping to dodge the crowds. I can feel it getting closer. My eyes sparkle like Deborah Kerr's when it comes into view. My gaze travels to the very top, where the ornate concrete rises in a steeple and crescendos into the iconic antenna. Christopher Reeve as Superman winks at me as he replants the antenna at the top of the tower.\" It's all magic to Mira. And then the real magic happens. She finds a ring. The ring becomes Mira's obsession as she wants to track down the person who lost it and reunite them with their possession. When it turns out that the ring is of Indian design, she is even more determined. This goal drives the rest of the novel. There is beauty and incredible heartbreak as the journey to locate the ring's owner has Mira meeting people who are wonderful and those who represent the worst of closed-minded hateful horrors. She must come to terms with the results of her indecision, her inability to stand up for herself, as she determines what her future will look like. The many pieces of the story come together perfectly at the end, satisfying our desire for a happily-ever-after and for wrongs to be righted. Not all of those wrongs are righted, but we'll take what we can get. In this charming and brilliant novel, brimming with difficult truths, it's as if Dev has created a magnificent smoothie out of ingredients that we wouldn't have imagined could work together. Yet all of the situations, the couples and their troubles, blend together to make something more --- something that we enjoy as much as it fortifies our soul.

            "review": " Tia Williams follows up the success of SEVEN DAYS IN JUNE (a 2021 Reese\u2019s Book Club pick) with A LOVE SONG FOR RICKI WILDE, an immersive, haunting and joy-filled blend of history and the present day, fantasy and fact, romance and creation. According to the Wilde family, if you look in the dictionary under \u201cblack sheep,\u201d you\u2019ll no doubt see a photo of Ricki Wilde. Ricki is the youngest of the privileged, esteemed Wilde girls, who are heiresses to their father\u2019s lucrative funeral home business. Her proud socialite sisters were happy to work their way up to owning their own franchises, thereby assuming control of their trust funds, but Ricki wants to make something of her own on her own. While her family has hosted galas, sipped on vodka and scheduled Botox appointments, Ricki has been quietly building her own empire. It\u2019s not a brick-and-mortar business like her father\u2019s, but an Instagram account, \u201cBotany Flowers Lately.\u201d Here, she shares her creative floral arrangements and boasts an impressive 300,000+ followers and brand partnerships lucrative enough to have secretly put herself through night school to earn a horticultural degree. In the Wilde family, though, the man --- that would be Richard Wilde, Sr. --- is the boss. And as the boss, he swiftly fires Ricki, telling her that if she wants to do it herself, she can go for it. \"Williams\u2019 writing is...a fresh and modern take on love and creation that is grounded in immense, sweeping history. The blending of these idiosyncratic tones reads like her love song to readers.\" A chance meeting lands Ricki in the basement apartment of a brownstone in Harlem, worlds away from her home (and family name) in Atlanta. She immediately sets to work cleaning up the front basement apartment, where she plans to launch Wilde Designs, and the smaller back studio, where she will live. After selling her car and three engagement rings (she has a type: quick to fall in love, quicker to fall out), Ricki has just enough savings to launch her business and give it her all. For exactly six months. If she fails, it\u2019s back to Atlanta, back to Wilde Funeral Homes, and back to what she not so affectionately refers to as the \u201cbrunchification of death\u201d --- aka her family\u2019s capitalist spin on the inevitable fates of their customers. Luckily for Ricki, chance is on her side. Her first few months in New York are marked by three incredible events: a steamy hookup with a smooth-brained, conspiracy-loving artist; an accidental meeting with Tuesday Rowe, a former child star and her current best friend; and, in her opening month, she not only meets her goals but doubles her projection. Then in January, she loses every cent when people stop coming to buy her gorgeous but expensive creations. However, chance isn\u2019t quite done with Ricki. On a midnight walk to blow off steam, she bumps into a man she comes to call Garden Gentleman. His features are cut from granite, his jawline is impossible, his brow is commanding and stern, and he\u2019s a musician, a creative like her. He tells Ricki one thing: that whatever is brewing between them can never, ever happen. But when repeated run-ins turn into daily drop-ins, it becomes obvious that there is something magical, fated between them, that has been building since before Ricki ever stepped foot in Harlem. Alternating timelines, Tia Williams takes readers to 1920s Harlem, where another young Black artist has just arrived in the city of magic. Ezra \u201cBreeze\u201d Walker III or IV (he can never be sure) has lost everything to Ku Klux Klan violence in his Georgia hometown, and he is finally ready to shed his dead-end sharecropper identity and give music, the thing that keeps him alive, a real try. Within five years, he is at the top of the jazz music scene in Harlem, where Black people are celebrated and his contemporaries aren\u2019t the church organ player but the likes of Duke Ellington, Fred Astaire and Ma Rainey. Unfortunately, with the highs come the lows. As fame takes over, Ezra (unknowingly) begins to race toward a cursed end. I won\u2019t reveal the mystery of how Ricki and Ezra\u2019s stories converge. But if the suspense isn\u2019t enough to draw you in, Williams\u2019 meticulous handling of history, sex, romance and fate will do the trick. To read Tia Williams is to read pure joy, unabashed and proud. Even when she is detailing the racist history of our country (especially sobering is the celebration of jazz-era Harlem compared to the current gentrification of those same buildings where history was made), her willingness and courage to find beauty in transformation is awe-inspiring. In her characters, particularly gorgeous, anxious and brilliant Ricki, Williams unlocks new levels of awareness and strength. Against all odds, they find ways to cultivate beauty in the world, turning their grievances and anxieties into pure creation. Much like a jazz song erupts from the fingers of its player, A LOVE SONG FOR RICKI WILDE soars. In an early scene, Ricki tries on the identity of a fl\u00e2neuse, a French concept built on idling and observing. She remarks that \u201cHarlem was a modern neighborhood superimposed over an old one. But in the negative spaces\u2026Ricki could make out the contours of a ghost city.\u201d Williams\u2019 writing is exactly like this: a fresh and modern take on love and creation that is grounded in immense, sweeping history. The blending of these idiosyncratic tones reads like her love song to readers. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on February 9, 2024",

            "review": " There is nothing like a tale of old Hollywood for glamour, drama, dreams and\u2026bloodshed. In the 1950s, stars and star makers, and gangsters and mafiosos, found their lives intertwined. From finances to romances, the famous and the infamous met, mingled and married in California and Las Vegas. The results were stormy at best and murderous at worst. In\u00a0A MURDER IN HOLLYWOOD, prolific true-crime author Casey Sherman presents the intersections of the film industry and crime syndicates through a look at the Turner-Stompanato murder case. \"Sherman offers a page-turner of an examination into one of the country\u2019s most notorious crimes. The narrative style is brisk and readable.\" In 1958, Johnny Stompanato, a mid-level gangster and gigolo and friend of the much more powerful Mickey Cohen, was stabbed to death in the home of award-winning and beloved actress Lana Turner. Turner\u2019s 14-year-old daughter, Cheryl, claimed responsibility, saying that she stabbed Stompanato in defense of her mother. Stompanato was Turner\u2019s on-again/off-again boyfriend, the latest in a string of often disastrous and even abusive relationships Turner had since her discovery at age 15. The investigation into and fallout from his death revealed not just Turner\u2019s own troubled history but also the cultivated yet dangerous connections between the entertainment industry and the mob. How did the former \u201csweater girl\u201d and the crook get together in the first place? It began as a plan to blackmail or extort Turner and ended in violence with plenty of misery along the way. Sherman writes about Turner\u2019s rags-to-riches success and her many heartaches, and he introduces Cohen, Stompanato and the other criminals who preyed upon so many of the Hollywood elite. The story is incredible --- thrilling, suspenseful, often pitiful. Turner and others like her were caught in a system of exploitation that made them vulnerable to many forms of manipulation and harm. And young Cheryl was a witness to much of it and was even less powerful. What really happened on that April night? Sherman offers a page-turner of an examination into one of the country\u2019s most notorious crimes. The narrative style is brisk and readable. There is not much analysis here, but the storytelling is sharp and compelling. The book\u00a0sheds light on cultural history and relations that tainted the glitz and aspirations, and the talents and successes, of some of the movie industry\u2019s biggest stars and most important artists. There are dark and astonishing moments here across decades of entertainment. At the center is Lana Turner and the two women closest to her: her mother and her daughter. Sherman always portrays her affecting humanity with respect and honesty. Rife with sexism, crime, secrets, power, love of all kinds and plenty of authorial conjecture,\u00a0A MURDER IN HOLLYWOOD offers an ambiguous theory of responsibility and leaves readers with plenty of questions and perhaps an interest in reading more about the seedy underbelly of mid-century Hollywood.

Lust and admiration for Helena, a chic older artist, brings the book\u2019s unnamed narrator to Ermoupoli, where Helena\u2019s daughter, Olga, seems at first like an obstacle and a nuisance. But the unpredictable forces of ego and desire take over, leading our narrator down a more dangerous path, and causing the roles of lover and beloved, child and adult, stranger and intimate to become distorted. As the months go by, the fragile web connecting the three women nears rupture, and the ominous consequences of their entanglement loom just beyond a summer that must end. With echoes of DEATH IN VENICE, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME and THE LOVER, but wholly original and contemporary, ANTIQUITY probes the depths of memory, beauty, morality and the narratives that arrange our experience of the world.",

            "review": " BECOMING ELLA FITZGERALD is Judith Tick\u2019s unique and valuable biography of one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest singers. Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s musical style has been and will continue to be cherished by those who share her wide range of genres, songs and syllables. Drawing on well-established sources, Tick\u2019s portrait begins as Ella began --- in a family officially designated at one time as \u201cmulatto,\u201d or mixed race. Her father left home when she was two, never to be seen again. Her mother, a hard-working woman, found another mate who moved the family from Virginia to Yonkers, New York. Though their neighborhood was not the best, it was a Black haven, and Ella excelled in her early education. But by her teen years, she was on the streets, spent time in a reformatory school, and by chance was \u201cdiscovered\u201d as she sang wherever she went. This led to her entry into a music competition, hoping to win recognition as a dancer. She ended up taking first prize --- as a singer. \"Tick brings Ella and her musical success to new light with diligent research, suggesting that she had many fears and sorrows. However, her determination and ability to rise and stay ahead was undeniable.\" What followed was a lifelong career that budded and bloomed with the help of admirers and those who thought to make a name or a fortune for themselves by touting and displaying her. Ella was reserved and rigorously polite in private, but she was different in public. She was adored by audiences and backed by a jazz band like that of Chick Webb, who first took her on (initially reluctantly) as a \u201cgirl singer.\u201d Her career ascent was steady and, by a certain point, dazzling, with television appearances on prime time and nearly constant touring. Her hits included \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d and \u201cIt Don\u2019t Mean a Thing.\u201d Those who saw Ella perform knew that she had controlled but sensuous movements to match the swing of the music, and that her voice was almost like a newly invented and never-duplicated horn or pipe. She performed with the greats of her era, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. She received a multitude of awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Some would say that she invented her chosen style of swing and made others want to imitate it. Her rhythmic \u201cscat\u201d singing was said to be the best in the world. Tick brings Ella and her musical success to new light with diligent research, suggesting that she had many fears and sorrows. However, her determination and ability to rise and stay ahead was undeniable. Tick offers a list of Ella\u2019s \u201cCharted Hot Singles,\u201d along with a lengthy bibliography. She portrays Ella in and out of the limelight with a kind of consistency that is a hallmark of those who gain enduring attention. No matter the size of her audience, Ella would review her set list before going onstage, making sure that it was appropriate and that she was fully prepared for the impression she wished to make. This is in line with what she said in her waning years: Sound and lyrics were her way of sharing, like \u201cneighbors, where we share and love each other.\u201d Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott on December 16, 2023",

            "review": " I never heard Maria Callas sing in person, but I fell in love with her voice --- uniquely dark and thrilling; wonderfully imperfect --- in my early 20s. I bought all her opera albums and saw her in a televised performance of Act II of Puccini\u2019s Tosca: a passionate, glamorous, murderous presence in red velvet and gold, all flashing eyes and high cheekbones. Don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t an opera buff. This novel about the famed Greek-American soprano isn\u2019t big on the musical aspect of her eventful career. Just as British author Daisy Goodwin\u2019s VICTORIA: A Novel of a Young Queen (2016; also a miniseries) sought to locate the woman within the monarch, DIVA emphasizes how Callas\u2019 artistry may have been sabotaged by her desperate need for love. Goodwin sets up her book as a three-act drama centered around Callas\u2019 very public nine-year affair with Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, which began in 1959. But within this structure there are plenty of flashbacks --- perhaps too many --- to her earlier life. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to suggest that driven, creative people are overcompensating for an unhappy childhood, but in Callas\u2019 case it seems to be true. Born in New York\u2019s Washington Heights (who knew?!) to immigrant parents whose marriage was already in trouble, and taken to Greece by her mother at age 13 (her father stayed in New York), she grew up in wartime, a hefty, glasses-wearing girl who lost the competition for maternal love with her older sister. Early on, Callas felt exploited by both her mother and her much older husband/manager, Giovanni Battista Meneghini, known as Tita. \"Callas\u2019 personality and talent make a rich subject, and anyone who loves her music and is intrigued by her colorful 'private' life will be drawn in by this book.\" Her voice was instantly acclaimed. And then, like a chrysalis, Callas emerged into full stardom: she lost weight, learned how to dress, and hobnobbed with the rich and famous. After crossing paths with the gossip columnist/society maven Elsa Maxwell, she was introduced to Onassis. Goodwin suggests that their bond was based not only on a shared Greek identity but on memories of growing up in hard times. \u201cWe have both had to struggle,\u201d Onassis told Callas. Unlike those born wealthy --- his wife, for example --- they were proudly self-made. At this point, DIVA becomes a \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d-esque miniseries in book form. The action moves between Onassis\u2019 yacht, the Christina; various luxury hotels and resorts; opera houses and upscale restaurants. Callas\u2019 wardrobe is described in enormous detail. Indeed, a simple computer search yields innumerable paparazzi shots of her, far taller than her husband or Onassis and almost always looking incredibly chic. According to Goodwin, this sense of style did not come naturally; she had a French design team who envisioned her as a goddess (\u201cNo frills, no bows, and absolutely no pink\u201d) and told her precisely which accessories to wear with which outfit. Ultimately, as we all know, Onassis betrayed Callas when he married Jackie Kennedy in 1968, a moment of public humiliation that begins and ends DIVA. But there were so many prior moments of infidelity, insensitivity and plain old lying on his part that it\u2019s difficult to believe that this came as a shock. At one point, Callas even attempted suicide while listening to her own recording of poor, abandoned Cio-Cio-San\u2019s aria \u201cUn bel di\u201d from Madame Butterfly (her performance is a masterpiece of power spliced with fragility). To my mind, though, what makes Callas a genuinely tragic figure was not her complicated love life but her anxiety about her voice, which, experts seem to agree, began to decline quite early in her career. The novel implies that her frequent cancellations and other prima-donna-ish behavior stemmed not from arrogance but from insecurity. Although the lure of her peripatetic life with Onassis may have been a distraction from work, more likely the problems had to do with the way she used, and abused, her voice in early performances. By the time she became more selective about what and when she sang, it may have been too late. In her Author\u2019s Note right at the beginning, Goodwin makes it clear that DIVA is a novel, not a biography, and that she has \u201ctaken a few liberties\u201d with dates in order to tell a compelling story. I don\u2019t mind that. Callas\u2019 personality and talent make a rich subject, and anyone who loves her music and is intrigued by her colorful \u201cprivate\u201d life will be drawn in by this book. I was especially interested in the idea that her passionate relationship with Onassis gave her new insights into powerful operatic characters like Norma and Tosca. However, I was bothered by the way the novel reads. It is chopped into multiple segments labeled for time and place, and further broken up by flashbacks and dialogue-heavy scenes. The effect is stilted and somewhat stagey, especially given cameo appearances by celebrities from Winston Churchill to Marilyn Monroe. There isn\u2019t a continuous narrative voice; it\u2019s more like a slideshow, with captions. Of course, Callas\u2019 life was nothing if not cinematic; in fact, a movie about her final days, Maria, is said to be opening this year. It stars Angelina Jolie and is directed by Pablo Larrra\u00edn, whose other films include the Oscar-nominated Jackie (the irony\u2026) and Spencer, about Princess Diana. He seems to have made a specialty of these lost, beautiful, press-hounded women. The tension between public and private self is common to all three, but Maria Callas was different from Jackie Kennedy or Diana Spencer. She is legendary because of her art, not her association with a famous man. This is made explicit in DIVA. At a party in Monte Carlo given by Prince Rainier and his wife, the former actress Grace Kelly, Callas observed Onassis flirting with Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy\u2019s sister and wife of a Polish prince. In a side conversation imagined by Goodwin, Princess Grace reminded Callas that \u201cyou and I\u2026are women in our own right. I have an Oscar and you are a great singer. But what is that so-called princess? Just a woman with a famous sister who dresses well and who laughs at men\u2019s jokes.\u201d Forbidden by Rainier to return to acting, Grace warned Callas not to stop singing. \u201cAristo [Onassis] isn\u2019t worth it; no man is.\u201d It\u2019s too bad that Callas didn\u2019t follow her advice. DIVA doesn\u2019t reach very far into the singer\u2019s post-Onassis life, but the novel certainly foreshadows the dwindling of her career and her premature death, of a heart attack, at age 53. What a loss. What a story. Reviewed by Katherine B. Weissman on January 26, 2024",

But even before Daphne began going on dates with boys, she started getting little notes --- on the backs of envelopes, on receipt paper, in fortune cookies, or on parking tickets --- that listed the name of a boy (or later a man) and a length of time. That duration, Daphne soon realized, indicated the length of time she'd spend involved with a romantic partner before they'd split up or grow apart, before he'd move or reunite with an ex. The duration might be months, or years, or maybe just a single night (ahem). But every time, without fail, the slip of paper arrives. Every time, Daphne knows exactly what she's in for and for how long. \"[EXPIRATION DATES] manages to be both remarkably romantic and quite unexpected, casting a charming spell on readers ready to believe in a little magic --- or just the miracle of the everyday.\" That is, until she meets Jake. Set up by a mutual friend, Daphne hits it off with Jake right away. And she's trying not to freak out about the fact that when she receives a paper with Jake's name on it, that's all there is. No duration, no indication that this love affair is ever going to end. Could this be it? Is Jake \"The One\"? Daphne is sure that he is, and for the first time in her life, she allows herself to believe in a happily ever after. But even as her relationship with Jake progresses, even as he shows her in a thousand different ways that he's her perfect match, Daphne knows there's something she should be telling Jake, a secret that might affect the duration of their relationship whether or not she plans for it. Daphne's ex-boyfriend (and still best friend), Hugo, is the only person who knows all of her secrets, but in this case he's probably the worst place for her to go for advice. She has to figure out on her own whether to trust the magic or to take a leap into the unknown. EXPIRATION DATES has a somewhat whimsical premise, but the underlying themes are serious. When do we know when to stop searching for love? How do we trust ourselves to know when we've found lasting love? Would believing in destiny blind us to another person's faults or just make us more accepting of them? And can you really fall in love if you're keeping secrets? Among other things, Rebecca Serle's novel is a love letter to Los Angeles --- not just to the entertainment industry in which Jake and Daphne work but also to the unsung, hidden places that most tourists might overlook or just be unaware of. It also manages to be both remarkably romantic and quite unexpected, casting a charming spell on readers ready to believe in a little magic --- or just the miracle of the everyday.

            "review": " I guarantee that FOURTEEN DAYS is unlike anything you have ever read. A \u201ccollaborative novel\u201d set in New York City in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdowns, its powerful stories are told by a number of different characters. The book\u2019s concept is a brilliant one. Led by general editors Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston, and on behalf of the Authors Guild, this is not a serial novel nor does it follow the rules of classic frame narratives as seen in such works as THE DECAMERON or THE CANTERBURY TALES. Rather, the 14 days depicted here contain a series of novellas strung together by its various authors to portray different stories being shared by the residents of an apartment building on the Lower East Side who meet on their rooftop every evening at 7:00 to cheer medical personnel. Here is a novel about the very essence of storytelling that celebrates the written word in an incredibly unique way. \"This is the best fictional work I have ever read regarding the pandemic; it is extremely touching and memorable. I only hope that it is never made into a film. FOURTEEN DAYS belongs exclusively to the readers.\" If there is a narrator here, it would be the building\u2019s Romanian super, who keeps a record of all the stories told over the two-week period. She learned how to do her job by watching her father (who also was a super) at a building in Queens when she was a child. She now laments how the pandemic has kept her from her father, who she would like to check on but has been unable to reach. The previous super kept a book referred to as \"The Fernsby Bible,\" which was named for the building and contained information on each tenant, along with the nicknames he gave them. Thanks to this resource, the current super quickly identifies the first six people who gather on the rooftop: Vinegar, Eurovision, the Lady with the Rings, the Therapist, Florida, and Hello Kitty. They get somewhat acquainted with each other and begin sharing stories. It isn\u2019t long before the group grows considerably as more tenants learn about this nightly ritual. Eurovision supplies the music, and they entertain each other with various tales. There\u2019s no need to look for a message, as some are just simply good stories. But they all work wonders in connecting people who otherwise are disconnected and are only brought together due to this global health crisis. Many of these stories are incredibly moving or ironic based on what is going on in their world. Several involve the dead or dying. For instance, Whitney, the museum librarian, provides a chilling tale about encountering a ghost while visiting the Alamo. Not everyone appreciates every story that is told. Some are true, while others are pure fiction. Eurovision kindly reminds them of the purpose of their sessions by quoting the great Oscar Wilde: \"Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.\" It will be purely up to the reader to try to determine which author contributed which piece of the story, as no names are attached to the 14 days. In all, 36 top-flight writers lend their talents to this unique exercise, and the results are truly something special. This is the best fictional work I have ever read regarding the pandemic; it is extremely touching and memorable. I only hope that it is never made into a film. FOURTEEN DAYS belongs exclusively to the readers. Reviewed by Ray Palen on February 9, 2024",

            "review": " You probably remember the Greek myth of Persephone. Having been abducted by Hades and made queen of the underworld, Persephone makes the mistake of eating pomegranate seeds and consequently is compelled to return to the underworld for several months each year. During that time, Persephone's mother, Demeter, goddess of the harvest, is in mourning. The earth mourns along with her, causing winter to return. On one level, this story is a nature myth, explaining the changing of the seasons in an imaginative and evocative way. It's also about the power imbalances between men and women, particularly when one of those men is the almighty god of the underworld and the other is a young woman whose relative power resides only in her physical allure. That's the element of the story that Rachel Lyon uses as the jumping-off point for FRUIT OF THE DEAD, her contemporary reimagining of the Persephone and Demeter myth. \"It's perhaps too easy to call FRUIT OF THE DEAD hypnotic, given the effects of the drug that ensnares Cory. But it does pull readers out of time and immerse them in a story that feels both ages old and entirely new.\" In Lyon's novel, the Persephone character is named Cory (a nod to Persephone's other name in Greek mythology, \"Kore,\" or \"the maiden\"). When readers first meet her, she's wrapping up a summer of camp counseling without a clear idea of what to do next. She hasn't gotten into college, and going to work for her mother Emer's agricultural NGO is not exactly appealing. Cory does have a special bond with one of the campers, a quiet little boy named Spenser. When, on the last day of camp, Spenser's dad, Rolo Picazo, sees how well Cory cares for his son and how easily she attracts the admiration of Spenser's younger sister Fern, he offers Cory an alternative. Recently divorced, Picazo has custody of both children for the next few months while their mother cares for the newborn she's had with her new husband. Picazo is a wealthy businessman whose professional life is about to get even more complicated. He could really use some help with childcare so that he can deal with the various legal challenges facing his pharmaceutical company. When he offers Cory the opportunity to spend this time on his private island off the coast of Maine, she barely hesitates before accepting. Cory finds Picazo oddly alluring, if not conventionally handsome. It also doesn't hurt that he's so wealthy and seems to genuinely find her fascinating. When she arrives at the island, she discovers some vaguely ominous signs, hints that she might have gotten in over her head. But when Picazo introduces her to his company's signature drug, Granadone, she ceases to care, losing track of her priorities, her purpose and even her sense of time itself. Third-person accounts of Cory's strange new life with Picazo alternate with first-person chapters from the perspective of Emer. In the face of shaky product test results and mounting concern for Cory, she takes off to find her daughter, at immense professional risk to herself. In part, Emer's impulsive actions are prompted by the present situation, but they're also an opportunity of sorts to reconcile a past betrayal, a time when she deeply disappointed Cory and damaged their relationship as a result. Those who are familiar with the original myth will find plenty of little Easter eggs to appreciate here. Picazo's three dogs, for example, are cloned versions of a single dog, making a sort of genetically engineered Cerberus. But this is far more than a clever retelling; it's also a thoroughly contemporary novel about the lure of narcotics, a powerful mother-daughter story about the lengths a mother will travel in order to save her most precious relationship, and a devastating indictment of power and risk imbalances between older, wealthy men and much younger women. It's perhaps too easy to call FRUIT OF THE DEAD hypnotic, given the effects of the drug that ensnares Cory. But it does pull readers out of time and immerse them in a story that feels both ages old and entirely new. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on March 29, 2024",

            "review": " The family at the heart of Rebecca K Reilly's debut novel, GRETA & VALDIN, are probably most likely to be compared to J.D. Salinger's iconic Glass family (even the title is reminiscent of Salinger's FRANNY AND ZOOEY). But as I was reading, I kept casting my mind back to one of my favorite childhood series, the Bagthorpe Saga by Helen Cresswell. Like the Bagthorpes, Reilly's Vladisavljevic family is eccentric, intelligent and prone to emotional fragility, and readers' first impression might be one of a glorious, confusing, muddled mess. Part of this stems from Reilly's approach to exposition. It takes readers many chapters to figure out basic facts such as characters' occupations, relationships and names (though the list of dramatis personae at the book\u2019s opening helps (as it does in many Russian novels, from which Reilly also seems to draw some inspiration). There are a lot of characters, many of whom share the same name. All of this becomes clear, but for the first 50 pages or so, readers may have the distinct feeling of being dropped into a wedding or family reunion, without a clear sense of family dynamics, backstories or inside jokes. \"Reilly's writing is charmingly deadpan, and her characters are true originals. Greta and Valdin's relationship is perhaps the most touching.\" However, things do gradually become clear, and readers eagerly will go along for the ride as soon as they're introduced to the distinctive voices of the title characters, who narrate most of the story in alternating chapters. Greta and Valdin are siblings in their 20s. Older brother Valdin is nursing a broken heart after the end of a relationship with Xabier (known as Xabi), who also happens to be their uncle's husband's brother. Valdin recently has embarked on a somewhat unexpected career trajectory. After years studying physics (and finally realizing that academic research made him miserable), he's now the host of a travel show on television. Younger sister Greta, who's earning her master's degree in comparative literature, also has been unlucky in love, though that may be about to change when she meets Ell, a graduate student in biology. It's a little awkward that Ell is in Greta's dad's department at the university, but that's hardly the biggest relationship complication that arises. Among other things, Greta is concerned that their mother (a M\u0101ori youth theater producer) may be harboring feelings for an old flame. Their father (also named Valdin but always called Linsh), who emigrated from Moldova to New Zealand when he was a child, is altogether too trusting, if not entirely clueless. A specialist in marine fungus, his mind is often a million miles away from the concerns that plague the rest of his family. If this all sounds complicated, it is, in the best possible way. The Vladisavljevic family members are smart, vulnerable and often very funny. Reilly's writing is charmingly deadpan, and her characters are true originals. Greta and Valdin's relationship is perhaps the most touching. Even as they start to look to romantic partners to form new kinds of families, they desperately need to keep one another as friends, touchstones and confidantes. One gets the sense that countless other stories could come out of this family. If Reilly hosts a family reunion, readers will be eager to crash the party.

            "review": " Happy relationships are possible --- for everyone. Even if you\u2019ve been married for 20 years and your routine is boring and stressful; although your mom has always been a help-resistant complainer; and despite the fact that your dearest friend moved across the country --- all of us can create lasting and joyful connections with the people we care about the most. Using simple tools drawn from the Buddhist tradition, you can cultivate appreciation, set wise expectations, and create meaningful and intimate bonds of mutual support and kindness with your partner, family and friends. That\u2019s because our happiness isn\u2019t dependent on everything in our lives being perfect. In fact, we can experience conflict, disagreement, job loss, grief and boredom and still have appreciation, delight and gratitude for everyone in our life. We can create happiness by improving the quality of our attention, the depth of our compassion, and our willingness to repair ruptures and let go of resentments. HAPPY RELATIONSHIPS is designed for all of us who are sometimes challenged by our husbands, wives, kids, parents and best friends. It\u2019s for anyone in happy marriages and close-knit families who want to feel closer and more connected to the most important people in their lives. HAPPY RELATIONSHIPS is a relatable and useful guide with practical applications to help us stay attuned and cultivate understanding with our dearest people: an inconsiderate partner repeatedly ignoring our requests; repairing the rupture from a conflict with a sibling; celebrating a child\u2019s success; or learning to communicate with a difficult parent. Each short chapter honestly describes, in three to four pages, a common shared experience --- such as the stress of old resentments, the opportunity of celebrating together mindfully, the nightly routine of a child\u2019s bedtime, spending time with old friends. It is followed by a brief practice --- a meditation, exercise or contemplation that readers can use to orient their beautiful qualities of love, kindness and wisdom to communicate and act in ways that lead to joy. HAPPY RELATIONSHIPS readers can use these practices alone or with their loved one anytime --- during the most mundane daily routine, to the excitement of a big gathering, through the sadness of loss.",

            ],
            "review": " According to a recent article in the New York Times, five years after the publication of her critically praised and popular 2013 novel, THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF NATHANIEL P., Adelle Waldman took a job unloading trucks at a Target near her home in Rhinebeck, New York, hoping to find inspiration for her next work of fiction. Readers of HELP WANTED, her reflective, wry second novel, will be happy she made this choice and succeeded handsomely in her search. If \u201cThe Office\u201d had been centered on the warehouse crew at Dunder Mifflin, but without playing its workers entirely for laughs, it might have looked something like Waldman\u2019s book. Set sometime during the Trump presidency in the fictional upstate New York town of Potterstown, a place that\u2019s \u201cas much museum as city\u201d since the departure of an IBM facility and the Great Recession, it focuses on the 13 members of \u201cTeam Movement\u201d at Store #1512 of the big-box chain known as Town Square. \"There are plenty of pundits commenting on the challenges facing working-class Americans today, but sometimes fiction\u2019s tools are more useful in exposing the truth. That\u2019s the beauty of what Adelle Waldman has accomplished here.\" The job of these part-time employees involves working a shift between 4am and 8am, unloading a truckload of merchandise in less than one hour and stocking the shelves with these items. Because their positions don\u2019t produce sufficient income to provide for them and their families, most have second jobs, relying on food stamps to help feed themselves and often foregoing health insurance. Like all physical retailers, their employer is locked in what feels like a desperate losing battle against an entity that Waldman refers to only as the \u201conline retailer,\u201d as if it \u201cpossessed occult powers by which the utterance of its name would strengthen it.\u201d The conflict at the center of HELP WANTED is launched by the impending promotion of Big Will, the store\u2019s manager. One of the two candidates to replace him is Meredith, the decidedly unpopular leader of Team Movement. Despite her loathing for her boss, a veteran team member named Val hatches a scheme to boost Meredith\u2019s chances. If she moves up, it will set in motion a chain of likely internal promotions that may include the plan\u2019s ringleader herself. With gentle humor, Waldman follows the execution of Val\u2019s at times ham-handed plan alongside Meredith\u2019s awkward last-minute effort to ingratiate herself with her underlings as the date for a decision approaches. One of her principal talents lies in efficiently creating appealing characters who are much more than predictable workplace archetypes, even as their diversity \u201cwould have made the headmaster of a private school bug-eyed with envy.\u201d In addition to sharing their varied histories, she does this by providing small but meaningful insights into their behavior that distinguish one from the other. Among them are the pride that one employee takes in her neat one-bedroom apartment and her reluctance to invite her co-workers to visit for fear that they\u2019ll disturb its order; the pleasure of another employee in initiating the unloading process in a way that tells a sort of story in the order he takes the boxes out of the truck, in one case \u201cdramatizing the human life cycle\u201d; and the distant dream of a third worker of earning a college football scholarship, even as he has accumulated a record of minor crimes and lacks the GED he\u2019ll need to advance at the store. Realistic or not, every one of Team Movement\u2019s workers, who might slip easily into a Richard Russo novel, harbors a vision of a better life. Some have struggled with drugs or alcohol, others have been unable to find happiness in stable romantic relationships. As Waldman portrays it, each faces obstacles --- whether personal or societal --- that for most of them make those goals seem unattainable, and she subtly evokes our ability to identify with them as human beings in the process. Waldman maintains the suspense surrounding whether or not Meredith will secure her promotion until near the end of the novel. But the outcome of that contest, and the success or failure of Val\u2019s scheme, is almost beside the point. In truth, the book is much more about illuminating the lives of the people who unload the trucks and stock the shelves at Target or Costco --- and, by extension, those of the millions of invisible others whose toil is essential to the functioning of the American economy. The Irish novelist Colum McCann once wrote, \u201cI happen to think that an ounce of empathy is worth a boatload of judgment.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to come away from this novel without at least a bit more empathy for its characters and their real-life counterparts. There are plenty of pundits commenting on the challenges facing working-class Americans today, but sometimes fiction\u2019s tools are more useful in exposing the truth. That\u2019s the beauty of what Adelle Waldman has accomplished here. Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg on March 15, 2024",

            "review": " Scott Carson is the pen name for legendary thriller writer Michael Koryta. I respect that Koryta\u2019s love of horror is strong enough for him to write under a different name so that he receives the accolades he deserves for stepping out of his typical comfort zone. His latest effort, LOST MAN\u2019S LANE, not only lives up to the hype but may be his best book to date. The novel reads like a superior work of literary fiction as it tells a coming-of-age tale set in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1999. However, just underneath the surface of this small town is plenty of horrific elements --- some human, some unexplainable and clearly of the supernatural variety. This is what torments our narrator, high school student Marshall Miller. He sees things that other people don\u2019t, which makes him both a valuable witness in a criminal case and a pariah later on. \"As I was reading this instant classic, I kept thinking about the iconic novels that it reminded me of, like Stephen King\u2019s IT, Dan Simmons\u2019 SUMMER OF NIGHT, and Robert McCammon\u2019s BOY\u2019S LIFE. This is literary horror written by a master storyteller at the top of his game.\" Marshall is an only child being raised by his mother, Monica, a popular meteorologist who is known for the tagline \u201cIt\u2019s Miller time.\u201d The big event for Marshall is finally getting his driver\u2019s license. Unfortunately, the first time he heads out on the road by himself as a licensed driver, he is stopped by the police. Corporal Maddox, who coyly pronounces his title \u201cCorporeal,\u201d berates Marshall for doing 39 in a 30 zone and uses language most would find inappropriate for a member of law enforcement. Marshall is shaken by the exchange and accepts his ticket. As Maddox pulls away, Marshall notices that there is a teenage girl in the back seat of the police cruiser wearing a dress that resembles the uniform at a local ice cream parlor. Readers should keep in mind that Marshall\u2019s keen sense of awareness and eagle eye will both help and hurt him. With no social media to speak of in 1999, AIM allowed for basic online communication. It is through this instant messaging service that Marshall, his buddy Dom, and his closest friend for whom he carries a torch, Kerri Flanders, find out about one of Sean Weller\u2019s legendary keg parties on Lost Man\u2019s Lane. At that first gathering, Marshall comes away with a potential girlfriend in Leslie Carter. When he shares the story of his run-in with Corporal Maddox, he finds out that there is no such position in the police department. He also learns that the girl he saw in Maddox\u2019s vehicle could be the missing Meredith Sullivan, who disappeared on the same day that he was pulled over. It turns out that Leslie\u2019s dad is a police officer, and she asks Marshall to share his encounter with him. This also brings the Meredith Sullivan case to the forefront of local media and provides hope for her parents, who have never stopped searching for her. Marshall reaches out to the private investigator, Noah Storm, who has been working with the Sullivan family to find Meredith. Marshall makes such an impression on Noah that he offers the 16-year-old a summer job as his one and only intern. Kerri gives Marshall some classic noir books to read in order to prepare for the internship, and he dives into his work feet first. One day, Marshall and Kerri go to Noah\u2019s home office, and Marshall is horrified to find his employer shot through the head and his throat slashed. He then sees his recent nemesis, Maddox, sitting on the staircase mocking him. He runs out of the house in a panic and contacts the police. None other than Detective Carter shows up, and after hearing Marshall\u2019s story, he is about to knock on the front door when Noah walks out unharmed and very much alive. Marshall is taken to the police station, where they grill him about his false claims and threaten him. He is no longer the town hero and quickly becomes the town liar. The Sullivans are devastated that his clue about their daughter was probably a lie. Marshall is sent to counseling, loses his job with Noah, and must deal with this unwanted infamy from everyone in town and, worst of all, his school. Marshall is positive about what he saw and now believes that not only is Maddox some sort of supernatural \u201ccorporeal\u201d figure but that Noah may not be who he claims to be. As I was reading this instant classic, I kept thinking about the iconic novels that it reminded me of, like Stephen King\u2019s IT, Dan Simmons\u2019 SUMMER OF NIGHT, and Robert McCammon\u2019s BOY\u2019S LIFE.

            "review": " Cara Black\u2019s Aim\u00e9e Leduc novels are such powerful mysteries that this long-running series has become the standard for strong female protagonists and Parisian-based stories. I firmly believe that these books are at their best when the plot deals with Aim\u00e9e on a personal level. No story to date is more personal than this 21st and latest entry, MURDER AT LA VILLLETTE. It is 2002, and Aim\u00e9e is on an undercover assignment at a company in Paris. While there, she finds a manager abusing one of the hired cleaning staff and promptly intervenes. Aim\u00e9e promises to stand up for Isabelle as a witness to protect her job and ensure that the actions against her are properly punished. She has no idea at this time how valuable an ally she has made in Isabelle. \"MURDER AT LA VILLETTE is indeed one of the finest entries in this series as Aim\u00e9e\u2019s entire litany of friends and family are involved in the most personal and confounding case of her career.\" Meanwhile, Aim\u00e9e continues to be harassed by calls from her ex-lover, J\u00e9rome Melac, all concerning a nasty custody battle involving their three-year-old daughter, Chlo\u00e9. She is reluctant to even listen to the messages, but for some reason she decides to play the most recent one. It is quite cryptic as Melac, a police detective, claims that he has \u201cjust seen a ghost.\u201d She calls him back, and he answers with a gurgle before the call cuts off. She fears he\u2019s in serious trouble and happens to spy along the canal by the drawbridge what looks like a figure floating in the water. It turns out to be none other than Melac, an obvious victim of an attack as his throat has been slashed. No sooner does Aim\u00e9e make this gruesome discovery than she is accosted from behind by someone with an authoritative tone who sounds like a policeman. He subdues her, sticks a bloody knife in her hand, and bashes her over the head so she would be found with the murder weapon that was used on Melac. Aim\u00e9e wakes up in the hospital and has difficulty seeing. Years earlier on a prior case, she sustained serious damage to her ocular nerve that nearly cost her her eyesight. Following examinations, she will be interrogated by the police as the prime suspect in Melac\u2019s murder. She contacts her godfather and mentor, Commissarie Morbier, to be there with her and use whatever influence he can to get her freed and back to Chlo\u00e9 as she knows she did not commit this crime. When the interrogation, as well as the lack of assistance from Morbier, does not seem to make for a rosy outcome, Aim\u00e9e finds the first opportunity to flee. Now on the run and wanted for Melac\u2019s slaying, she must attempt to work the case herself to clear her name so she can return to her precious daughter. The first guardian angel she runs into is the very same Isabelle she helped out earlier. It turns out that Isabelle works with a local biker gang and has a side gig pedaling wholesale cigarettes. They take Aim\u00e9e in and provide her cover. They also are the eyes and ears of the neighborhood and will assist with any evidence they can uncover about the case. Aim\u00e9e begins her private campaign to obtain freedom by speaking with those who might be able to help. A young research assistant makes her aware of the decades-old case involving the serial killer known as le Belafre, who raped and murdered both young women and grandmothers in ritualistic fashion from 1986-1994. Since he was never brought to justice, word has it that he might be back at work again. Could he have been the \u201cghost\u201d Melac saw the night of his murder? If so, might he be a current or former police officer, which could explain why Morbier backed off when Aim\u00e9e told her story about someone else being at the scene of the crime? As the situation gets more dire and deadlier, Aim\u00e9e realizes that she does not know who she can trust. Even her current boyfriend, who works with the police, refuses to assist her --- making her believe that the \u201cblue wall of silence\u201d is indeed working against her and that she truly is alone. She turns up both good and bad clues and/or red herrings and receives unexpected help along the way. Even with some sort of assistance, Aim\u00e9e is still in constant peril, and Cara Black continues to throw one roadblock after another her way straight through to the surprising conclusion. MURDER AT LA VILLETTE is indeed one of the finest entries in this series as Aim\u00e9e\u2019s entire litany of friends and family are involved in the most personal and confounding case of her career.

Using the meager clues available, he and his archaeologist friends embark on a quest to piece together the mystery of her death. In 1851, the newly widowed Madeleine Talmadge and her orphaned nieces, Jane and Lydia, seek the aid of a cunning spiritualist, Alexander Dodge Lewis. Lewis leads them on a perilous journey from one s\u00e9ance to the next, attempting to summon the spirit of Madeleine\u2019s late husband and promoting Lydia's latent abilities as a medium. Jane, suspicious of his motives and fearful of his influence, seeks to disentangle her aunt and cousin from Lewis\u2019 beguiling sphere --- with dire consequences. As the past collides with the present, layers of time peel back to reveal long-buried secrets of loss, love and murder. Alongside its riveting plot, RIDDLE OF SPIRIT AND BONE offers subtle rumination on what can be observed, what can be known, and what can be trusted.",

            "review": " The \"illuminating\" (New Yorker) story of the Great Chicago Fire: a raging inferno, a harrowing fight for survival, and the struggle for the soul of a city --- told with the \"the clarity --- and tension --- of a well-wrought military narrative\" (Wall Street Journal). In the fall of 1871, Chicagoans knew they were due for the \u201cbig one\u201d --- a massive, uncontrollable fire that would decimate the city. It had been bone-dry for months, and a recent string of blazes had nearly outstripped the fire department\u2019s already scant resources. Then, on October 8th, a minor fire broke out in the barn of Irishwoman Kate Leary. A series of unfortunate mishaps and misunderstandings, along with insufficient preparation and a high southwesterly wind, combined to set the stage for an unmitigated catastrophe. The conflagration that spread from the Learys' property quickly overtook the neighborhood, and before long the floating embers had been cast to the far reaches of the city. Nothing to the northeast was safe. Families took to the streets with every possession they could carry. Powerful gusts whipped the flames into a terrifying firestorm. The Chicago River boiled. Over the next 48 hours, Chicago fell victim to the largest and most destructive natural disaster the United States had yet endured. The effects of the Great Fire were devastating. But they were also transforming. Out of the ashes, faster than seemed possible, rose new homes, tenements, hotels and civic buildings, as well as a new political order. The elite seized the reconstruction to crack down on vice, control the disbursement of vast charitable funds, and rebuild the city in their image. But the city\u2019s working class recognized only a naked power grab that would challenge their traditions, hurt their chances to keep their hard-earned property, and move power out of the hands of elected officials and into private interests. As soon as the battle against the fire ended, another battle for the future of the city erupted between its entrenched business establishment and its poor and immigrant laborers and shopkeepers. An enrapturing account of the fire\u2019s inexorable march and an eye-opening look at its aftermath, THE BURNING OF THE WORLD tells the story of one of the most infamous calamities in history and the new Chicago it precipitated --- a disaster that still shapes American cities to this day.",

            "review": " Writing this review feels like a rite of passage for me. THE COMFORT OF GHOSTS is the 11th Maisie Dobbs mystery I've reviewed for Bookreporter. Since Jacqueline Winspear has announced that it will be the final installment, I know many readers will share my feelings of both appreciation and wistfulness as this brilliant series comes to a close. When we met Maisie Dobbs in 2003, she was a young woman in 1929, just getting her feet under her as a private investigator and learning from her mentor, while still coping with her experiences as a nurse during the Great War. Now, Maisie is a mature wife and mother with a successful career and a comfortable home life. But in 1945, she and so many others in England are still coping with the aftermath of two devastating world wars. \"[E]ven though readers might be disappointed that there are no new Maisie Dobbs mysteries to anticipate, they can gain comfort in the fact that this wise, compassionate and resilient protagonist will always be available for a return visit in the pages of Winspear's resplendent series.\" The ways in which wartime trauma is recapitulated has been an ongoing theme of the series, and that continues to be true here. A young man is at death's door, nearly starving and inarticulate. As we soon discover, he is a newly released prisoner of war, still reeling from torture in a Japanese prison. He also has a close relationship with one of Maisie's oldest and dearest friends. Maisie's discovery of him in a London home introduces her to four British teenagers, surprising foot soldiers in an underground civilian army, trained and ready to mobilize should the Nazis invade. By 1945, it's clear that this possibility has faded, but these young people remain profoundly scarred not only by the intensity of their training, but by a murder they claim to have witnessed. THE COMFORT OF GHOSTS is really two mysteries in one. At first, Maisie sets out to gather more information about the apparent Nazi sympathizer --- one with surprising ties to another of Maisie's acquaintances --- whose death the children have described. But in the book\u2019s final third, the mystery grows more personal, as newly discovered information sheds light on a long-buried family secret, one with relevance to Maisie's very first cases all those years ago. Winspear utilizes an image of a dragon to describe the ways in which the damage of war, even for the civilian population, continues to haunt the British people emerging from 30 years of war. She shows how the scars of war can be borne physically but also manifest themselves in surprising, sometimes uncontrollable ways: in the form of addictive behaviors, unexplained violence, suspicions, damaged relationships and broken hearts. At times, Maisie's journey in this final novel can feel like Old Home Week, as she reconnects with almost all of the (still living) characters who have played recurring roles in the series and provides more backstory on them. This level of exposition might be a bit unnecessary, especially for longtime fans. However, it\u2019s possible that this walk down memory lane will prompt some nostalgic readers to want to start from the beginning. The good news is that they'll be able to do so in style. Winspear's publisher is planning a 20th anniversary re-release of the first book later this year. So even though readers might be disappointed that there are no new Maisie Dobbs mysteries to anticipate, they can gain comfort in the fact that this wise, compassionate and resilient protagonist will always be available for a return visit in the pages of Winspear's resplendent series.

            "review": " From the New York Times bestselling author of MANHUNT (now an Apple TV+ series) and in the tradition of EMPIRE OF THE SUN MOON comes \u201ca vivid account\u201d (The Wall Street Journal) of a forgotten chapter in American history: the deadly confrontation between natives and colonists in Massachusetts in 1704 and the tragic saga that unfolded. Once it was one of the most infamous events in early American history. Today, it has been nearly forgotten. In an obscure, 200-year-old museum in a little town in western Massachusetts, there stands what once was the most revered relic from the history of early New England: the massive, tomahawk-scarred door that came to symbolize the notorious Deerfield Massacre of 1704. This impregnable barricade --- known to early Americans as \u201cThe Old Indian Door\u201d --- constructed from double-thick planks of Massachusetts oak and studded with hand-wrought iron nails to repel the tomahawk blades wielded by several attacking Native tribes, is the sole surviving artifact from one of the most dramatic moments in colonial American history: In the leap year of 1704, on the cold, snowy night of February 29th, hundreds of Indians and their French allies swept down on an isolated frontier outpost to slaughter or capture its inhabitants. The sacking of Deerfield led to one of the greatest sagas of survival, sacrifice, family and faith ever told in North America. One hundred and twelve survivors, including their fearless minister, the Reverend John Williams, were captured and forced to march 300 miles north into enemy territory in Canada. Any captive who faltered or became too weak to continue the journey --- including Williams\u2019s own wife --- fell under the tomahawk or war club. Survivors of the march willed themselves to live and endured captivity. Ransomed by the royal governor of Massachusetts, the captives later returned home to Deerfield, rebuilt their town and, for the rest of their lives, told the incredible tale. The memoir of Rev. Williams, THE REDEEMED CAPTIVE, published soon after his liberation, became one of the first bestselling books in American history and remains a literary classic. The Old Indian Door is a touchstone that conjures up one of the most dramatic and inspiring stories of colonial America --- and now, at last, this legendary event is brought to vivid life by popular historian James Swanson.",

Each seemingly insignificant scene and name is a clue for astute mystery aficionados. Tenure hinges on Professor Neil Weber writing a \u201cdissertation on bystander apathy,\u201d inspired by witnessing a woman drown when he was six. Including Neil, no one tried to save her. \u201cWriting\u201d is a euphemism for monolithic writer\u2019s block. Not a word has been composed, but then he notices a poster of missing student Lucia Vanotti. \u201cLucia had become a stand-in for everything that had gone wrong in my life.\u201d Neil assuages his personal bystander guilt by investigating, which places him in the suspect seat. \"THE DEPARTMENT is over-the-top brilliant and intellectually intriguing, with a concussion-grenade conclusion. It is sure to earn an Anthony Award nomination, likely the Big Kahuna: Best First Novel.\" Neil\u2019s dumpy apartment \u201cwas a true testament to how far I\u2019d fallen,\u201d alongside his failed marriage with Phaedra Lewis. Both are philosophy professors at the same campus. Since philosophy is their gig, Phaedra writes, \u201c[T]he work of mourning is always doomed to fail. One is marked by the loss of the other from the outset. There is no getting over loss. Loss is the condition of existence.\u201d Neil fixates on visions of Phaedra, including her standing on a purple carpet of jacaranda blossoms in New Jersey. The reader is volleyed between Neil and Lucia\u2019s narration, then and now. Lucia is a complex character plagued by trauma, shame, guilt and ongoing self-doubt. She is a developed character with the insight of one who is twice her 20 years. The reader yearns to comfort her, though she projects a shield of defiance. Each character has strength and vulnerable weakness churning like the Pollock analogy. This classic whodunit/whydunit with a stunning finale is also a tragic tale of loss and failed attempts at redemption. The reader becomes a student in the Philosophy department, or perhaps a guinea pig to be examined. THE DEPARTMENT is over-the-top brilliant and intellectually intriguing, with a concussion-grenade conclusion. It is sure to earn an Anthony Award nomination, likely the Big Kahuna: Best First Novel.

A legendary model and style icon, she reveled in headline-grabbing romances with not one but three members of the hugely influential rock band the Midnight Ramblers. The band members were as famous for their backstage drama as for their music, and Anke is the only one who fully understands the tangled relationships, betrayals and suspicions that have added to the Ramblers\u2019 enduring appeal and mystique. That is most evident in the mystery around Anke\u2019s role in the death of Mal, the band\u2019s founder and Anke\u2019s husband, in 1969. When Mari Hawthorn accepts the job to work with Anke on her memoir, she is dead set on getting to the truth of Mal\u2019s death. She has always been deft at navigating the fatal charms of celebrities, having grown up with a narcissistic, alcoholic father. As she ingratiates herself into the world of the band, she grows enchanted, against her better judgment, by these legendary rock stars. She knows she can\u2019t get pulled in too deep, otherwise she\u2019ll compromise her objectivity --- and her integrity.

No one expects the police to knock on the million-dollar, two-story home of the perfect cul-de-sac housewife. But soccer mom Lara Love Hardin has been hiding a shady secret: she is funding her heroin addiction by stealing her neighbors\u2019 credit cards. Lara is convicted of 32 felonies and becomes inmate S32179. She learns that jail is a class system with a power structure that is somewhere between an adolescent sleepover party and LORD OF THE FLIES. Furniture is made from tampon boxes, and Snickers bars are currency. But Lara quickly finds the rules and brings love and healing to her fellow inmates as she climbs the social ladder to become the \u201cshot caller,\u201d showing that jailhouse politics aren\u2019t that different from the PTA meetings she used to attend. When she\u2019s released, she reinvents herself as a ghostwriter. Now, she\u2019s legally co-opting other people\u2019s identities and getting to meet Oprah, meditate with The Dalai Lama and have dinner with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But the shadow of her past follows her. Shame is a poison worse than heroin --- there is no way to detox. Lara must learn how to forgive herself and others, navigate life as a felon on probation, prove to herself that she is more good than bad, and much more. THE MANY LIVES OF MAMA LOVE is a heartbreaking and tender journey from shame to redemption, despite a system that makes it almost impossible for us to move beyond the worst thing we have ever done.",

            "review": " From the New York Times bestselling author of THE FLIGHT OF GEMMA HARDY, a novel about a young woman whose gift of second sight complicates her coming of age in late-19th-century Scotland. Growing up in the care of her grandparents on Belhaven Farm, Lizzie Craig discovers as a small child that she can see into the future. But her gift is selective. She doesn\u2019t, for instance, see that she has an older sister who will come to join the family. As her \u201cpictures\u201d foretell various incidents and accidents, she begins to realize a painful truth: she may glimpse the future, but she can seldom change it. Nor can Lizzie change the feelings that come when a young man named Louis, visiting Belhaven for the harvest, begins to court her. Why have the adults around her not revealed that the touch of a hand can change everything? After following Louis to Glasgow, though, she learns the limits of his devotion. Faced with a seemingly impossible choice, she makes a terrible mistake. But her second sight may allow her a second chance. Luminous and transporting, THE ROAD FROM BELHAVEN once again displays \u201cthe marvelous control of a writer who conjures equally well the tangible, sensory world...and the mysteries, stranger and wilder, that flicker at the border of that world.\u201d (The Boston Globe)",

            "review": " Thanks to two outstanding seasons on ABC, millions of new Will Trent fans have been born. I am proud to say that I have been there from the beginning as Karin Slaughter has been dishing out first-class thrillers in this series for quite some time. In Slaughter's most recent release, THIS IS WHY WE LIED, the quirky but extremely precise GBI investigator is in fine form and dealing with a unique case while on his honeymoon with his bride, Sara Linton, the medical examiner he has worked with for years. They have left Atlanta for an excursion to McAlpine Lodge deep in the woods in an off-the-grid setting that promises activities you would expect from life in the mountains. Slaughter provides a full map of the Lodge and the surrounding area, which comes in very handy. It ends up becoming the Clue board on which a murder mystery game is about to be played. \"Karin Slaughter\u2019s writing is like a house on fire and is so intricately plotted that I just could not turn the pages of this one quickly enough.\" Will and Sara\u2019s attempt at a late-night skinny-dipping session at the nearby lake is abruptly thwarted by a bone-chilling scream. After clumsily putting his clothes back on, Will discovers the body of Mercy McAlpine, the manager of the Lodge. She is covered in blood, the result of several stab wounds, but is still alive. Will proceeds with CPR as she whispers to him that she doesn\u2019t want her 16-year-old son to see her and urges him to let someone know that she forgives them. She then succumbs to her wounds, which becomes a homicide for Will and Sara to investigate. So much for their honeymoon. Sara makes Will aware that his hand has been skewered by the blade that had been sticking out of Mercy\u2019s stomach as he began chest compressions. She skillfully removes it without any nerve damage, and their focus shifts to the residents of the Lodge who are now suspects. They consist of three other couples staying at various cabins, as well as the entire McAlpine family, all of whom are employed there and live on the property. The staff and kitchen workers went home at 8:30pm, so they are in the clear. The story eventually shifts back to 10 hours before the murder, slowly working its way up in real time to the homicide and the ensuing investigation. There are so many broken and suspicious relationships to tease any mystery fan, and there is a dual meaning to the book\u2019s title. Initially, Will and Sara are there with fake bios so as not to reveal their law enforcement roles, and Sara utters those words to explain their reasoning for the deception. The same quote is also used by one of the residents at the Lodge, which rings true when Will and Sara begin to battle their way through lie after lie to try to find the guilty party. Will Trent is one of the most interesting crime fighters out there, and I love spending time with him. I can\u2019t get the image of actor Ramon Rodriguez out of my head as I am reading, even though he doesn\u2019t physically resemble the Will Trent of the novels. Karin Slaughter\u2019s writing is like a house on fire and is so intricately plotted that I just could not turn the pages of this one quickly enough. Reviewed by Ray Palen on August 23, 2024",

            "review": " Camille Delaney returns with another investigation --- and this time it\u2019s personal. Shackled to her bed against the pleas of the medical staff, Charli Zhao gives birth to a beautiful daughter she names Willow. Charli had been transported to the hospital from prison, where she is serving time for a crime she didn\u2019t commit. Within hours of the birth, the unthinkable happens: the newborn is abducted, leaving Charli devastated and wondering if she\u2019ll ever find her child, even after she gets free. Attorney Camille Delaney isn\u2019t used to the inside of women\u2019s prisons --- she works in courtrooms. But when a local legal aid group recruits her to help with a case on the inside, she feels drawn to these women\u2019s stories. They are often so similar --- a lifetime of trauma culminating in the heartbreaking and often permanent loss of custody of their children, even after they\u2019ve served their time and gotten clean. When Camille meets Charli, it\u2019s been years since Willow was abducted, and the case has gone cold. But there\u2019s something about Charli\u2019s story --- and Charli herself --- that Camille can\u2019t refuse. With the help of her trusted friend and private investigator, Trish Seaholm, Camille begins a dogged pursuit to find Charli\u2019s daughter and bring the man who framed Charli to justice. As Camille\u2019s quest for the truth takes her team from Seattle to the San Juan Islands to the mountains of Olympic National Park, she must reckon with a system that routinely dismisses the rights of convicted mothers --- and has their children pay the price.",

            "review": " *Please note: This review may contain what could be considered spoilers. Be sure to keep that in mind as you're reading the review. Sarah Langan returns to her horror roots with a cautionary tale set in the near future that is truly spine-tingling. A BETTER WORLD introduces a broken, dystopian world not unlike ours where a new community has risen with their own solutions for staving off extinction in the face of global and geological cataclysm. If you have ever read anything about so-called perfect, idyllic societies or watched \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d then you have experienced the prospect of a too-good-to-be-true situation. The problem is that it almost always is. That is the same horror that the Farmer-Bowens family must experience here, as they relocate from deadly New York to Plymouth Valley. This walled-off community is run by BetterWorld, a company that makes a polymer called Omnium. Its main ingredient is recycled plastic, and it\u2019s used for such things as rope, clothing, bags and machine parts. \"Sarah Langan returns to her horror roots with a cautionary tale set in the near future that is truly spine-tingling.... It is quite a ride, with Langan maintaining a tenuous finger on the pulse of a possible world to come that becomes the biggest horror story of all.\" The novel splices in various marketing and promotional materials from Plymouth Valley. The first one is pure propaganda trying to entice the like-minded with quotes like \u201cnamed the most beautiful place to live in North America three years in a row\u201d and \u201cself-sustaining farm.\u201d The community of approximately 4,500 also follow their own belief system, Hollow, which acts as a substitute religion. Additionally, they have created their own protein in the form of caladrius, which are monstrous hybrid chickens with sharp teeth. Russell, a science advisor; his wife, Linda, a part-time pediatrician; and 15-year-old twins Josie and Hip are being interviewed for consideration to be invited into Plymouth Valley. They obviously want Russell the most because of what he can do scientifically with Omnium, but the entire family must be on their best behavior because they work on an ultra-creepy merit system where those who do not earn their rank and stay in line are bounced out. Or worse. It is not much of a choice when the opportunity is presented to them, as the rest of the world is suffering through a great unwinding where annihilation seems to wait around every corner. Josie and Hip begin to sniff out the truth about Plymouth Valley first, followed shortly thereafter by Linda. One real red flag are the Pagan-like rituals that the community follows with fervor. They have an offering schedule, broken up into four seasons, that replaces any traditional religious observance. They also have two feasts that include violence. Samhain, the original name for Halloween, features a deadly maze. The 5K run on Thanksgiving, which every resident from ages 10 to 90 must participate in, takes the slowest runner and uses that person for future culling. This would occur at their biggest event: the three-day Winter Festival, where the whole town lives together in the bunker-like tunnels that run beneath the community. Linda is very curious about the Winter Festival, but she can\u2019t get a straight answer from anyone about what takes place. All she knows is that some sort of sacrifice needs to be made for the greater good. She just assumes that it\u2019s a theoretical sacrifice, like an ugly caladrius. Once they crown their annual Beltane King --- a sadistic role that leads to the punishment parts of the rituals previously mentioned --- Linda knows that she and her family are in big trouble. She just can\u2019t get past the fact that Russell has drunk the Kool-Aid and doesn\u2019t see a problem with any of this. Langan includes various articles from journals written in the near and far future, which speak about Plymouth Valley in the past tense and the tragedy that occurred there. It is obvious that we are going to live through those events along with the Farmer-Bowens. Every relationship that Linda attempts to make goes terribly wrong, and she is soon on the outs with the elders of the community. Josie is having an equally hard time and is caught vandalizing a sign during the Samhain festivities. Hip is trying to integrate and even has a new girlfriend, but he reluctantly admits that it is all in an attempt to help out his mother with the powers that be. As the Winter Festival approaches, the underlying dread that Langan has created begins to bubble and boil out of control as it becomes obvious that there will not be a happy ending for the Farmer-Bowens. It is quite a ride, with Langan maintaining a tenuous finger on the pulse of a possible world to come that becomes the biggest horror story of all. Reviewed by Ray Palen on April 13, 2024",

            "review": " Whenever I review a new title from David Baldacci, I always marvel at how this prolific writer remains fresh and interesting with each release. That being said, his latest novel, A CALAMITY OF SOULS, is completely different. It took him 10 years to complete, and it may be not only one of his finest books to date, but quite possibly his most important. Two sheriff\u2019s deputies from Freeman County, Virginia, open this story with the apprehension and brutal beating of a Black man who has been arrested as the only possible suspect in the murder of his elderly white employers. The accused is Jerome Washington, and the victims are the extremely wealthy Leslie and Anne Randolph. \"There are so many twists in this unpredictable thriller, with some serious instances of human depravity sprinkled in for good measure, that it reads like a literary classic.\" Defense attorney John Robert Lee, who goes by Jack, has been making a name for himself but is about to become aligned with a case that seems impossible to win or receive any justice for. While visiting his parents, he receives a message that Miss Jessup had called there for him and needed to speak with him. She has been known to the family for decades and is a well-respected maid to one of their neighbors. Jack and his father take a ride to the Black part of town to meet with Miss Jessup. She proceeds to tell Jack that her son-in-law, Jerome, was wrongfully arrested for the Randolphs\u2019 murder. Employed by them as a handyman, he found their bloodied, lifeless bodies in their bedroom as deputies arrived. The law wants to railroad Jerome for this gruesome double homicide and is already threatening the death penalty. Jack meets with Jerome and is shocked by how badly beaten and injured he is. The assigned defense attorney did nothing to help Jerome and merely moved along with the prosecution\u2019s case. Jack believes Jerome, a decorated Vietnam veteran, and agrees to defend him. Keep in mind that the book\u2019s setting is the late 1960s, shortly after the assassinations of MLK and RFK, when there is little to no chance for a Black man in these circumstances to escape the death penalty in the South. As Jack begins to look into the matter, he receives almost a complete wall of resistance and hatred. When the prosecution brings in a heavy hitter from out of town, he realizes the magnitude and importance of this case. And the likelihood of an all-white jury does not make this uphill task any easier. Assisting Jack is Desiree DuBose, a Black lawyer who specifically works on racially charged cases such as this one. She is well-educated, well-spoken and unlike anything the courthouse in Freeman County has ever seen. Not only does this unwinnable case weigh on Jack, his team is faced with dirty surprise upon dirty surprise. David Baldacci has done such an outstanding job plotting this lengthy tale that there is not much I can say about this intense case without giving away something juicy. There are so many twists in this unpredictable thriller, with some serious instances of human depravity sprinkled in for good measure, that it reads like a literary classic. A CALAMITY OF SOULS is indeed an important novel, one that Baldacci was born to write and a story to which only he could do justice. Reviewed by Ray Palen on April 18, 2024",

Freya\u2019s dreams abruptly become reality when her husband betrays her to the region\u2019s jarl, landing her in a fight to the death against his son, Bjorn. To survive, Freya is forced to reveal her deepest secret: She possesses a drop of a goddess\u2019s blood, which makes her a shield maiden with magic capable of repelling any attack. And it\u2019s been foretold that such magic will unite the fractured nation of Skaland beneath the one who controls the shield maiden\u2019s fate. Believing he\u2019s destined to rule Skaland as king, the fanatical jarl binds Freya with a blood oath and orders Bjorn to protect her from their enemies. Desperate to prove her strength, Freya must train to fight and learn to control her magic, all while facing perilous tests set by the gods. The greatest test of all, however, may be resisting her forbidden attraction to Bjorn. If Freya succumbs to her lust for the charming and fierce warrior, she risks not only her own destiny but the fate of all the people she has sworn to protect.",

Lord Rosemorran has purchased a wax figure of a beautiful reclining woman and asks Stoker to incorporate a clockwork mechanism to give the Rosemorran Collection its own Sleeping Beauty in the style of Madame Tussaud\u2019s. But when Stoker goes to cut the mannequin open to insert the mechanism, he makes a gruesome discovery: this is no wax figure. The mannequin is the beautifully preserved body of a young woman who was once very much alive. But who would do such a dreadful thing, and why? Sleuthing out the answer to this question sets Veronica and Stoker on their wildest adventure yet. From the underground laboratories of scientists experimenting with electricity to resurrect the dead in the vein of Frankenstein to the traveling show where Stoker once toured as an attraction, the gaslit atmosphere of London in October is the perfect setting for this investigation into the unknown. Through it all, the intrepid pair is always one step behind the latest villain --- a man who has killed once and will stop at nothing to recover the body of the woman he loved. Will they unmask him in time to save his next victim? Or will they become the latest figures to be immortalized in his collection of horrors?",

            "review": " Simone St. James, the bestselling author of such works as THE BOOK OF COLD CASES and THE SUN DOWN MOTEL, returns with her trademark blend of thriller and horror. MURDER ROAD is a decades-old ghost story set in a deserted town featuring an unlucky couple who just might be the key to ending it. As Eddie Carter drives their beat-up Pontiac down the interstate on the way to the Five Pines Resort on the shore of Lake Michigan, April cannot believe her luck. Not only has she escaped the transient, terrified years of her youth, she has just married the most tender, compassionate man she has ever met --- and his Army body doesn\u2019t hurt, either. The two began dating and got married in the same year, but neither would define their romance as a whirlwind. Between April\u2019s traumatic past and Eddie\u2019s own brushes with PTSD from his time in Afghanistan, their bond is no less love-filled but is much calmer than your average shotgun wedding. \"Simone St. James has an innate talent for blending genres without doing a disservice to either, and that is on perfect display in MURDER ROAD.\" The two know how to react effectively and efficiently, and despite their traumas, their insides are still waters. So when they make a few errant turns and end up on the wrong highway, it\u2019s no big deal. When they see a strange, glowing light in the woods, it just might be a local or a freak trick of the light. And when they see what they first believe to be a small man, and then a young woman, walking on the side of the desolate, deserted highway, they assume she just had one too many at the local watering hole. Aware of the dangers that young women face when alone, they agree to pull over and ask if she needs help, or at least a lift somewhere. She\u2019s not drunk, but she\u2019s not all there either. She wears an oversized jacket, and she seems confused but not stupid. When she reluctantly gets in their car, she tells them that her name is Rhonda Jean and she needs to go to a hospital. April realizes too late that the jacket is hiding a lot of blood. But Rhonda\u2019s next reveal is the most terrifying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d Almost immediately, headlights flash through their rear window, and a big, imposing black truck begins to approach their vehicle way too fast. Eddie quickly taps into his military training and goes silent, his focus only on speeding toward the nearest anything, even as the truck matches his speed and every turn point for point. Through sheer luck, the unlikely trio turns onto a back road and loses the truck, but their pursuer is the least of their worries. Eddie barely turns into the hospital parking lot before he and April realize two things: Rhonda is not going to survive her wounds, and they have just deposited a dying woman they don\u2019t know at the hospital, their car and their clothing all drenched in her blood. It\u2019s not a good look, and the local detectives are quick to call them on it. But this isn\u2019t your average mystery. Shortly after the local force begins to question April and Eddie, a menacing state police officer arrives, telling the town\u2019s police to back off and that this is officially a state police issue now. It\u2019s alarming, to say the least, but it also makes April and Eddie curious: Why have the state police taken such an interest, and why do they seem dead-set on pinning Rhonda\u2019s death on them? Oh, and there\u2019s the one thing that they aren\u2019t telling police, local or state. When the black truck passed them, Eddie saw a teenage girl in the truck bed, dirty and disheveled and screaming for help. So, as the police zero in on the newlyweds, April and Eddie embark on their own investigation --- not just into Rhonda or the truck, but also into the road where they first encountered her: Atticus Line. As locals are quick to inform them, this is not the first life that Atticus Line has taken; the deaths on the same stretch of road go back nearly 30 years. This leads April and Eddie to a homemade hostel for transient youth, to teenage girls who have been tracking the deaths on the road for longer than they even knew it existed, and even to the history of the police force. Each new clue and possible line of investigation dovetails into one disappearance and legend: that of the Lost Girl, Atticus Line\u2019s first victim, and more than likely the ghostly teenage girl Eddie saw screaming from the back of the truck. But even though deaths have been occurring on and off for years, April and Eddie are the only ones to ever discover a murder midway, and the only ones to have seen the Lost Girl and lived to tell the tale. It is obvious that something led them to Atticus Line, and they are powerless to ignore the clues that something dark has a hold on the deserted town\u2019s desolate road. But why did it choose them? Simone St. James has an innate talent for blending genres without doing a disservice to either, and that is on perfect display in MURDER ROAD. While the supernatural element is apparent early on, so too is the mystery and the obvious failings of the local and state police forces to figure it out. This combination is not just compelling, it's downright propulsive. St. James can occasionally dwell on her characters\u2019 extraneous backstories for a bit too long, but the pull of the classic mystery storyline and the ghoulish supernatural keeps the pacing fast and tight.

            "review": " At one point in Jayne Anne Phillips\u2019 NIGHT WATCH, a character in 1874 West Virginia observes, \u201cThe fighting has ceased, but not the grief.\u201d That short sentence encapsulates much about this book, which is largely concerned with the persistent repercussions of trauma after the American Civil War. Much of the novel centers on the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, where 12-year-old ConaLee arrives with her mother at the start of the story. ConaLee, whose mother has not really spoken in quite some time, is brought there by a man who insists that both ConaLee and her mother call him \u201cPapa,\u201d even though he\u2019s neither one\u2019s father. The mother and daughter have left ConaLee\u2019s young siblings --- a toddler and infant twins --- behind and disguised themselves as a wealthy woman and her orphaned companion. \"[Phillips\u2019] writing can be elliptical, requiring numerous rereadings to discern the depth of the action or emotion. Those rereadings reward the determined reader as the cumulative effect is one not only of historical veracity, but also of emotional truth.\" The reasons for the woman's silence, and for their arrival at the asylum, gradually come into focus, as the novel travels backwards in time to earlier years, both before and during the war. It also follows several different characters, most notably Dearbhla, an Irish healer, who has intimate quasi-maternal connections with both of ConaLee\u2019s parents, as well as a man we meet as \u201cThe Sharpshooter\u201d but whose actual identity and relevance only becomes clear later. The significance --- and malleability --- of names is a major theme of the novel, as various characters utilize new names to hide something, to take on a new identity, or to reinvent themselves. When she arrives at the asylum, ConaLee is instructed by Papa to call her mother \u201cMiss Janet\u201d and create a new name for herself. Several characters have the same names; their similarity or overlaps might happen by design or by accident. The name ConaLee chooses for herself is \u201cEliza,\u201d which, it turns out, carries a significance that she only learns much later. Some have names that only describe their functions: for example, the aforementioned \u201cSharpshooter\u201d or the titular \u201cNight Watch.\u201d Just as names converge and overlap, so do characters, as history resurfaces to inform the present. These namings and renamings can feel creative, liberating, almost playful. But NIGHT WATCH, perhaps unsurprisingly, also has a darker streak. Befitting a novel about a gruesome war, the book contains numerous scenes of violence --- not only violence on the battlefield but also sexual violence against women. These scenes can be difficult to read, but they help to underscore the multifaceted horrors of war and explain the ways in which the asylum serves as a place of fear but also of safety and refuge for women like ConaLee and her mother. Phillips did a lot of research for NIGHT WATCH --- including visiting the real-life asylum, which is now a national historic site --- and she includes archival photos and documents throughout the text. Her writing can be elliptical, requiring numerous rereadings to discern the depth of the action or emotion. Those rereadings reward the determined reader as the cumulative effect is one not only of historical veracity, but also of emotional truth. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on September 29, 2023",

            "review": " At various critical moments throughout this remarkable memoir co-written with Kim Green, Chantha Nguon reflects on the protracted but satisfying process of preparing and cooking handmade noodles the way her mother did. You couldn\u2019t shorten or hurry the method. If you did, the end product would betray a lazy cook in both its taste and its texture. Hence the title SLOW NOODLES, a lifelong metaphor for patience --- often unimaginably extreme patience --- amid a life of danger and uncertainty. Nguon describes her childhood self as a pampered and \u201csoft\u201d middle-class Cambodian girl growing up in the 1960s in her hometown of Battambang in the eastern region of Cambodia. The youngest of a large family, she learned early that no matter how prosperous life might be, a family\u2019s future was always invested in its boys. Girls were meant to serve and work domestically, even though there were many signs of change in the world beyond her home. \"At various critical moments throughout this remarkable memoir co-written with Kim Green, Chantha Nguon reflects on the protracted but satisfying process of preparing and cooking handmade noodles the way her mother did.... You will never read another food-inspired memoir like SLOW NOODLES.\" But by teaching her daughters unusually high standards of cooking and sewing, their mother --- a founding heroine of SLOW NOODLES --- equipped them to fend for themselves in an uncertain and misogynistic society that would soon be torn apart by decades of overlapping wars in Southeast Asia. Little did young Chantha know how critical those skills would become. While maintaining the compliant exterior demeanor expected of Cambodian women, she met every challenge by internally strategizing how to best deal with it in the moment. The deaths of her father, mother, sister and other close relatives came in cruelly rapid succession as the family\u2019s fortunes rapidly declined. She found herself alone as a vulnerable twenty-something adult, an internally displaced refugee in a war-ravaged country with dreams of escaping to Europe or North America. Those dreams were dashed at every turn, costing all of her meager savings each time. Virtually homeless, Nguon survived year after humiliating year by cooking for others. She somehow remembered the vast store of recipes taught by her mother, learning how to adapt them to the often sparse ingredients and conditions at hand. SLOW NOODLES recounts numerous examples of how her meals fed every level of Cambodia\u2019s disrupted society of the 1960s and \u201970s --- businesspeople, professionals, students, soldiers, fellow refugees, aid workers, and even prostitutes as young as 12 who were sold into sexual slavery by their destitute parents. While Nguon\u2019s life until middle age was an extraordinary patchwork of disasters and opportunities held together by her own dogged resilience, two pivotal influences stood out for me as I followed the breathless pace of her narrative. First, Nguon encountered Chan, a young man in similar straits who radically did not believe women to be inferior. He insisted on her keeping pace with him as they fled one precarious situation after another, survived acute hunger and jungle diseases, or worked long hours at tedious jobs to raise more travel money. Second, the pair encountered the international NGO, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, where they learned urgently needed paramedical skills and worked on and off for a number of years. Those skills would help them create new lives focused on helping others. Thrown together in times of dire necessity, Nguon and Chan\u2019s survival partnership gradually grew into a life relationship as well. They never made it out of Southeast Asia, instead returning to Cambodia to become rebuilders of their all-but-lost culture. Since then, they have established educational, medical and entrepreneurial programs, raised children of their own (who did, in fact, get to study and live overseas), and eventually created stable lives after decades of deprivation, fear and frustration --- experiences that Nguon emphasizes belong to all Cambodians of their era. So where do the book's nearly two-dozen recipes fit? Nguon shares them whenever a certain food played a major role in salvaging the mental or physical health of those among whom she found herself, in both good times and bad. Each dish comes with deep and indelible memories, especially the eponymous \u201cslow noodles.\u201d Its lessons sustained a life that otherwise might have dissolved, as forces much larger tried, but ultimately failed, to eradicate Cambodia forever. You will never read another food-inspired memoir like SLOW NOODLES. Reviewed by Pauline Finch on March 2, 2024",

            "review": " Amitav Ghosh unravels the impact of the opium trade on global history and in his own family --- the climax of a yearslong project. When Amitav Ghosh began the research for his monumental cycle of novels, the Ibis Trilogy, 10 years ago, he was startled to learn how the lives of the 19th-century sailors and soldiers he wrote about were dictated not only by the currents of the Indian Ocean but also by the precious commodity carried in enormous quantities on those currents: opium. Most surprising of all, however, was the discovery that his own identity and family history were swept up in the story. SMOKE AND ASHES is at once a travelogue, a memoir and an essay in history, drawing on decades of archival research. In it, Ghosh traces the transformative effect the opium trade had on Britain, India and China, as well as the world at large. The trade was engineered by the British Empire, which exported Indian opium to sell to China to redress their great trade imbalance, and its revenues were essential to the empire\u2019s financial survival. Following the profits further, Ghosh finds opium central to the origins of some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations, of America\u2019s most powerful families and prestigious institutions (from the Astors and Coolidges to the Ivy League) and of contemporary globalism itself. Moving deftly between horticultural history, the mythologies of capitalism, and the social and cultural repercussions of colonialism, in SMOKE AND ASHES Ghosh reveals the role that one small plant has had in making our world, now teetering on the edge of catastrophe.",

            "review": " Given the rate of divorce in America, it\u2019s not surprising that memoirs about marital strife are proliferating, which is bound to induce a sense of d\u00e9ja vu when yet another one appears. But when it happens to be written by an author as talented as Leslie Jamison and is as relentlessly candid and eloquent as SPLINTERS: Another Kind of Love Story, there\u2019s good reason to put aside any reservations and dive in. SPLINTERS is a multi-themed tapestry whose threads are woven with precision and grace. In it, Jamison wrestles with an ever-lurking army of her own demons, including her almost obsessive need to please, which is only one facet of her lifelong struggle to measure up to some external standard of excellence in her personal and professional lives. It\u2019s also the bittersweet story of Jamison\u2019s relationship with her daughter in the first two years of the child\u2019s life. This ground-level glimpse of the joys and difficulties of parenting in those early years is complicated here by the tensions of a marital fracture and her own intense ambition. Jamison primarily trains her keen attention on the difficult years following the end of her relatively brief marriage to novelist Charles Bock (referred to as \u201cC\u201d in her account). He came to their relationship after his first wife\u2019s long struggle with cancer that ended with her death. They married at midnight in a wedding chapel in his hometown of Las Vegas, and their daughter was born in the winter of 2017. This was not long before Jamison embarked with the newborn on a lengthy multi-city tour to promote her book, THE RECOVERING: Intoxication and Its Aftermath, an exploration of the relationship between substance abuse and creativity seen through the lens of her own alcoholism and sobriety. \"SPLINTERS is a multi-themed tapestry whose threads are woven with precision and grace.... Jamison digs deeply here, and SPLINTERS overflows with vivid imagery and descriptions that animate her recollections.\" A product of divorce herself, Jamison, not yet married as she entered her 30s, had \u201cwanted the solidity of what you couldn\u2019t undo,\u201d but it became evident well before their daughter\u2019s arrival that her marriage to C, nearly 15 years her senior, was foundering. Despite several years of couples counseling, she realized that the end was inevitable and that she would have to be the one to end it. Jamison frankly regrets that, in deciding to wed C after only six months, she \u201clistened to the part of myself that was falling in love, and ignored everything else.\u201d The reality of her marriage was that \u201canother woman\u2019s death was nestled inside every moment between us. It was the house we lived in,\u201d and her inability to repair the profound damage of that loss was one of the principal factors that doomed their union. Separated from C and freshly ensconced in a railroad one-bedroom sublet next to a firehouse, she quickly discovers how challenging the world of single parenthood will be, especially after she returns to her teaching job. She frequently yearns for a partner who can help share her burden, even as that need is balanced against the intensity of her devotion to her daughter. The soundtrack of her days is a kind of staticky buzz, as she acknowledges \u201chow the volatility of my life was a noise that drowned out all other frequencies.\u201d And yet, for all these tensions, one of the aspects of SPLINTERS that refreshingly distinguishes it from many divorce memoirs is the absence of vituperative score-settling. Despite references to C\u2019s anger (\u201cthe humidity of his unspoken rage\u201d) and descriptions of a couple of ugly scenes during the transfer of their daughter in their custody-sharing arrangement, she takes pains to emphasize his positive qualities. In the essays collected in THE EMPATHY EXAMS and MAKE IT SCREAM, MAKE IT BURN, Jamison\u2019s writing has always been distinctive for its specificity and effective use of sensory detail. She explains to her students that \u201cdigging underneath the cocktail-party version of a story was like turning over a smooth stone to get at the moss and dirt below.\u201d Jamison digs deeply here, and SPLINTERS overflows with vivid imagery and descriptions that animate her recollections. When she loses her sense of smell to COVID, she confesses to missing \u201cthe vegetable reek of a mold-spotted cucumber. The urine tang or compost stink of my daughter\u2019s drooping diapers.\u201d And in those same frightening early days of the pandemic, Jamison recalls her daughter \u201cpouring shards of pita chips down the neck of her rainbow llama pajamas\u201d or how she \u201cspent her days spearing Internet-delivered raspberries with the baby fork.\u201d Jamison reveals something of her post-separation dating life, including a relationship with a tall, tattooed musician who \u201cplayed torch songs in dive bars all over the world\u201d and refers to himself as a \u201cprofessional tumbleweed.\u201d It\u2019s an intensely physical encounter in which she vainly pictures herself in a contented domestic partnership with a man \u201cin love with the way he broke things\u201d and for whom monogamy isn\u2019t even a meaningful aspiration. In this relationship and one with a philosophy PhD turned hedge fund manager, she wrestles with her affinity for the unending passion of romantic life (she\u2019s a \u201ccreature designed to fall in love, over and over again\u201d) and the persistent need to please her partners, rooted in her relationship with her distant father. By the end of SPLINTERS, Jamison achieves a sort of hard-earned peace, moving away from the idea of a divinity \u201cwho would give me enough gold stars if I did enough good things, and toward the mother who\u2019d been here all along --- with less patience for my performances and more patience for everything else. I was living toward joy that was less about earning, and more about ambush. A joy you might call grace.\u201d As this memoir reflects, she\u2019s the kind of person --- and, above all, the kind of writer --- whose life certainly will never go unexamined. We\u2019re all the beneficiaries of that gift. Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg on February 23, 2024",

            "review": " At one point in THE ANGEL OF INDIAN LAKE, the final entry in Stephen Graham Jones\u2019 Indian Lake trilogy, Jade Daniels asks, \u201cDo you like scary movies, Mr. Holmes? I used to. Until I had to try to live through them.\u201d Our engaging, one-of-a-kind protagonist is talking out loud to one of her late teachers with whom she often has one-sided conversations. Jade is an expert in all things horror, a proud half-Native American, an ex-con, a current history teacher and, depending on who you ask, either the savior or the damnation of her hometown of Proofrock, Idaho. \"I have always been a huge fan of Stephen Graham Jones\u2019 work, but I truly applaud what he has accomplished with this trilogy and the tireless amount of work he needed to draw from to keep the constant horror references popping.\" If you have not read the previous two novels, MY HEART IS A CHAINSAW and DON\u2019T FEAR THE REAPER, then I highly recommend that you do so prior to diving into this one. Additionally, if horror and hearing non-stop about it through often obscure references is not your thing, then you should have a lot of fun educating yourself in this area. That means deep-diving way beyond just the Halloween and Scream franchises. Horror is the language of preference used by Jade, and for aficionados of the genre like me, she quickly will become your new hero if she isn\u2019t already. When we met Jade, she was the self-professed ultimate \u201cfinal girl,\u201d primarily due to her love of slasher movies and the uncanny survival instinct she gained from them. She has been able to thwart a serial killer in each of the first two books, and then another one, Dark Mill South --- following an unforeseen prison stint --- in DON\u2019T FEAR THE REAPER. Now, Jade has returned to Proofrock once again. While some of the players have changed, along with her surprisingly turning establishment and taking a job as a high school history teacher, the tragic history of Proofrock always looms overhead threatening to strike again. Bad things will happen, this time in the form of the legendary and feared Angel of Indian Lake. Jones refers to this quote from American professor and medieval history expert Carol Clover: \u201cThere\u2019s never been a final girl like this.\u201d I can think of no better way to define Jade, an extremely memorable character who makes a great impression on anyone who has followed her story. She is going to need every ounce of her willpower and encyclopedic knowledge of horror literature and films to battle the curse of the infamous Lake Witch that is back to punish Proofrock\u2019s hapless residents. Jade does not have many allies in this battle and has to join forces with the new sheriff to take on the evil that has returned. Initially, she is turned on to the threat because of the number of citizens who have disappeared or been tragically killed while exploring the town\u2019s dark past. This is all interspersed with non-stop horror references that will leave fanboys and fangirls giddy with joy. Another great storytelling gimmick Jones employs is various notes from Jade\u2019s record that explore her integration back into society post-prison and PTSD, as well as a full psychological profile on her that lets you know what the real world thinks of her. Her bill of mental health alone will have you second-guessing everything she does. All sorts of supernatural shenanigans get stirred up, which leads to an epic finale. There is never a dull moment in this final installment, and it will be difficult to say goodbye to Jade. I can only share what Jones noted about THE ANGEL OF INDIAN LAKE: It was \u201ctime to say goodbye to Jade Daniels.\u201d Whether this is bidding her a fond farewell or watching her ultimate demise, I will leave to the surprise of the lucky readers who have stuck with her through one of the most memorable horror series I have ever experienced. I have always been a huge fan of Stephen Graham Jones\u2019 work, but I truly applaud what he has accomplished with this trilogy and the tireless amount of work he needed to draw from to keep the constant horror references popping.

            "review": " Kelly Link, known as the \u201cmaster of the short story\u201d for bestselling works like GET IN TROUBLE and WHITE CAT, BLACK DOG, makes her novel debut with THE BOOK OF LOVE. Seven years in the making and at a whopping 640 pages, it is further proof that Link\u2019s masterly control of magic and mayhem knows no bounds. One year ago, young adults Laura, Daniel and Mo died, vanishing suddenly and without warning or explanation from their cozy seaside community aptly named Lovesend, Massachusetts. In the year since, their families have succumbed to grief, splintered into rage, and reformed in new configurations that willfully ignore the missing branches of their family trees. Susannah has struggled the most. She lost her sister, Laura; her occasional lover, Daniel; and her friend, Mo. Even more than her grief over her sister and friends, though, she senses that something else is missing: the truth. Although she dwells in Laura\u2019s room, tends to their depressed mother, and has ceased causing the trouble of her youth, she can\u2019t shake her lingering anger at her sister. Then, just as suddenly as they disappeared, the three youths find themselves in their brightly lit high school music classroom. They are being observed by their teacher, Mr. Anabin, a harmless, meandering sort of man known more for his corny affirmational t-shirts than his teaching abilities. The room is a welcome reprieve from the colorless, joyless space they have occupied for the past year. But where was that, why did they end up there, how are they back, and who is the fourth person now accompanying them? After being magically manifested by Mr. Anabin, this stranger tells them that he cannot recall his name or think of any others. Casting a glance around the music room, they name him Bowie. \"Full of mysteries and magical contracts both ancient and new, and characters whose lives move with and against time, this spellbinding novel upends and reinvents what fantasy can do and what it can be.\" But Bowie is not the last member to join their impromptu gathering. Just as they are getting their bearings and coming to terms with the world again, a great white dog enters the classroom before morphing into a human. The man is familiar and unfamiliar, known and unknown. He is the one who has watched over them for the last year, and he is not happy about their jailbreak. Without any explanation, Mr. Anabin and the dog-man, who the young adults find out is called Bogomil, strike a bargain: Laura, Daniel, Mo and Bowie will perform tasks to demonstrate their control of magic, truth and love. When their scores have been tallied, two will return and two will remain. Their first assignment is twofold: the nearly insurmountable task of trying to remember how they died and performing a bit of magic. Neither god nor man, Mr. Anabin has magicked the world into fitting them in again, inserting memories of full scholarships to a prestigious program at a private conservatory in Ireland into the minds of their families and former classmates. Laura, Daniel and Mo will return home as if nothing has happened, and Bowie (whoever he is) will complete his tasks alone. If it sounds like Bowie has drawn the short straw, that is only because you don\u2019t know what happened before Laura, Daniel and Mo disappeared. One year ago, Laura and Susannah Hand and Daniel Knowe were members of a band cleverly named My Two Hands Both Knowe You. On the night of their disappearance, tension was brewing as they performed at a local watering hole. Susannah, always attuned to chaos, had kissed an audience member as part of their act. This individual was Laura\u2019s longtime crush, and Susannah picked him with the intent of hurting her sister. Laura quickly kissed Daniel, Susannah\u2019s on-again, off-again lover, in retaliation. It\u2019s an interesting dilemma, certainly worthy of a soap opera or teenage romance. But is it enough to have landed Laura, Daniel and poor Mo, who had no romantic entanglements with any of the band members, in the afterlife, and now in this liminal space contained by bargains and contracts? No, but it\u2019s a start. What Laura, Daniel, Mo, Bowie and even Susannah don\u2019t know is that a sort of war has been brewing for centuries. Three-hundred years ago, a betrayal unbalanced the cosmos and heavens and set their fates into motion, long before they were even conceived or thought of. Alternating between the perspectives of our doomed protagonists and the supporting cast --- high priests, goddesses, lovers, classmates, and even bartenders and waitresses --- Link unfolds a narrative as eternal and timeless as a fairy tale, and as gripping and resonant as a current event. While the main conflict is the teens\u2019 deaths and their fight to return to mortality, Link dives deep into each of their lives to explore queer love, racism, blended families, sibling rivalry and so much more. There are many love stories here, and they span the breadth between lucky and unlucky, doomed and vindicated, but not all of them are romantic or even full of love. Anyone who has ever read a short story by Kelly Link knows that she is extremely talented. The recipient of a MacArthur Genius grant, she wields the title of \u201cgenius\u201d well, and this ambitious undertaking is no exception. THE BOOK OF LOVE is indeed a tome, yet her writing remains true to form: beautiful and transcendent, dreamlike and magical\u2026and rooted in universal, crystalline truths of fact and feeling. Written as a series of \u201cbooks\u201d --- the chapters are focused on single characters --- it reads like a fairy tale and a play, with the \u201cbooks\u201d moving against and in accordance to the others, allowing readers to really sink into each character the way you might get to know a new friend or lover. In composition and style, this is an enchanting and moving novel, though I\u2019ll be the first to admit that Link\u2019s attention to detail --- particularly the lives of her supporting characters --- can be unwieldy at best and totally distracting at worst. It\u2019s a testament to her control of her magic and her ability to contort and manipulate common words into magical configurations and spells that I still could not put the book down. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it wouldn\u2019t have been tighter (and certainly easier to hold) at a smaller page count. Full of mysteries and magical contracts both ancient and new, and characters whose lives move with and against time, this spellbinding novel upends and reinvents what fantasy can do and what it can be. But I cannot wait to see what Link does when she is more comfortable in this longer format and better able to restrain her narrative so that it matches her perfect, transcendent prose.

            "review": " Yangsze Choo's new novel, THE FOX WIFE, is an atmospheric and magical blend of Asian folklore, a mother\u2019s search for revenge, and the mystery of a missing girl. \u201cFoxes, people say, are wicked women.\u201d The year is 1908, and the Qing dynasty is in decline after ruling China for three centuries. The population, which considers the Qings to be invaders, has become restless, relying on old folk tales and superstitions for guidance rather than the Western sciences and technologies that have begun creeping across Japan and China. Unlike the changing world, with its battles for cities and titles, superstitions remain the same --- dependable and comforting --- and no superstition is quite as prevalent as that of the fox. In Northwest China, villagers still worship at fox shrines, consult mediums channeling fox spirits, and invoke exorcists to drive out particularly cunning ones. So naturally it makes sense that THE FOX WIFE is narrated in part by a fox. Possessing the keen ability of a fox to transform into a woman, Snow Hu has infiltrated a wealthy pharmaceutical family with an eye on vengeance. Some time ago, a photographer named Bektu Nikan commissioned the death of her child, her fox pup, and she has hunted him ever since. \"THE FOX WIFE is a brilliant, luscious exploration of identity, revenge and mortality. Choo achieves the perfect literary balance in her writing: lyrical and cadenced, but charmingly accessible.\" However, Snow is not the only hunter in town. Not too long after she arrives, the body of a decorated courtesan is discovered on the steps of a popular restaurant. Wearing a flimsy, beautiful dress and a beatific smile, the mysterious woman was unidentified when her case was closed and her body was buried. But since her death, the restaurant has fallen on hard times, with suspicious happenings plaguing their kitchen, their books and their clients. Desperate to preserve his business, the owner calls in Bao Gong, a renowned detective known for his ability to sniff out even the most convincing lie. What the owner doesn\u2019t know --- and what most of Bao\u2019s clients don\u2019t know either --- is that Bao\u2019s ability is neither learned nor practiced, but a gift given to him by a fox god as a child. Because his unique talent is so tightly tied to the legends of fox gods and spirits, he feels innately tied to these mystical beings. When he hears that a white fox appeared on the same night the woman died, his interest is piqued. But before he unveils the tie between the woman and the fox, he must identify her and learn how and why she died alone on the stoop that freezing night. With both Snow and Bao in Manchuria, their investigations lead them to the same name: Bektu Nikan. While Snow wants to murder the man who caused the death of her pup, Bao\u2019s course is a bit more complicated. He learns that the dead woman may be a sex worker who disappeared from a nearby brothel and that she recently had captured the fancy of Mr. Wang. This wealthy man is known for hosting glamorous parties with professional \u201centertainers,\u201d and he may be keeping a few of his favorite entertainers and courtesans locked away in his compound. With the body buried, Bao is in search of one specific clue: a photograph taken by Nikan. His sources tell him that Nikan is hiding in the remote Wu Village. Meanwhile, Snow\u2019s work as a maidservant to the matriarch of an esteemed family has put her in the crosshairs of another fox masquerading as a human. Her mistress seems keenly aware of the spirit world and distrusts her grandson\u2019s close friendship with the cunning, foxlike (oh so foxlike) Shirakawa, and she tasks Snow with determining the true nature of their friendship. Privately, Shirakawa (known to Snow as Shiro) tells Snow that he knows about her search for revenge, and he is willing to lead her to Nikan. But the photographer-murderer is now in Japan, where Shiro plans to take her mistress\u2019s grandson on \u201cbusiness.\u201d As her own plans for vengeance dovetail with her mistress\u2019s journey to Japan to protect her grandson, it would seem that luck is in Snow\u2019s favor. But she cannot shake the ominous feeling that trouble lies ahead. At the same time, as Bao approaches Wu Village, the overtones of foxes and lost girls start to fill him with the uneasy sensation that he\u2019s approaching a sort of shadow realm where lies and half-truths will be uncovered, and the line between life and death, civilization and wilderness, will be blurred, if not broken. What awaits Snow in Japan has dangerous repercussions. As Bao\u2019s investigation starts to uncover ties between the missing girl, the photographer and rumors of a beautiful, cunning white fox, it becomes apparent that the spirits have intervened. Alternating chapters between Snow\u2019s search for vengeance and Bao\u2019s search for answers, Yangsze Choo weaves an absorbing, atmospheric tale that is part love story, part mystery and all magic. THE FOX WIFE is a brilliant, luscious exploration of identity, revenge and mortality. Choo achieves the perfect literary balance in her writing: lyrical and cadenced, but charmingly accessible. Even as she details complex histories and various versions of popular mythologies, she welcomes and invites readers into the richness of her text, never obfuscating or overwriting her themes. The character of Snow is written with a wry, whimsical voice. While her search for revenge is enough to keep you reading, it is her clear-eyed observations on the imbalances between men and women (both as humans and as foxes) that give this novel serious heft and make it seem timely and inciting, even as it dives deep into China\u2019s storied history. It goes without saying that some suspension of disbelief is required here, but the payoff is worth double the cost of entry. Choo\u2019s masterly handling and control of her mythologies make suspension easy and belief rewarding. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on March 2, 2024",

Over the course of this series, King has created her own Holmes universe building on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s original stories. THE LANTERN\u2019S DANCE is special in that it is full of Holmes\u2019 history, and we learn much more about this iconic sleuth by the end of the book. Mary Russell is on crutches from a badly sprained ankle during a prior adventure. She and Holmes are off to France to visit his son, world-renowned artist Damian Adler. Newcomers to this series surely will be asking themselves, Holmes has a son? Stay tuned for more on that! \"THE LANTERN\u2019S DANCE is special in that it is full of Holmes\u2019 history, and we learn much more about this iconic sleuth by the end of the book.\" Russell and Holmes are met by a man wielding a shotgun who accompanies them to the house. But Damian and his family are not there. Apparently, they were forced to flee unexpectedly due to a personal threat. Thus we have our mystery, and Holmes goes off in search of Damian. Meanwhile, Russell and her bad foot remain at Damian's place. While exploring the empty house, she comes across crates of memorabilia in Damian's studio marked for Holmes' great-uncle, artist Horace Vernet. Much of this stuff is random, but Russell picks up a journal that will become quite eye-opening as she dives into it. Let's take a step back for a moment. Fans of Holmes most certainly will remember his old paramour and sometime adversary, Irene Adler, who he met in the story \"A Scandal in Bohemia.\" It turns out she carried a child belonging to Holmes and kept that fact hidden for many years. After her passing, Holmes connected with Damian, with whom he has a tenuous relationship at best. Still, family is family, and Holmes is worried about the safety of his son and grandchild. The journal that Russell is poring over was written many decades ago by a young woman named Lakshmi, who is half-Indian. She was being raised by a new family in a small village in India, but her story is full of mystery and secrets that, upon solving, will begin to reveal information about her and her connection to the Holmes legacy. One item in particular that is being referenced constantly is a spinning lantern. When a candle is placed inside it and it\u2019s spun around, various silhouettes are shown that each add a piece to Lakshmi's personal history and story. Meanwhile, Holmes locates Damian safely and (after much prodding) learns of the facts behind the threat that drove him away. I will not reveal any details here as they most assuredly will connect to the revelations that Russell is simultaneously discovering in Lakshmi's journal. When Lakshmi's fate is revealed to Russell, she realizes exactly where this story fits into the Holmes legacy. And it's a whopper! Though not your traditional Russell/Holmes mystery, THE LANTERN'S DANCE becomes a can\u2019t-miss read for any Sherlock Holmes fan. Reviewed by Ray Palen on February 17, 2024",

            "review": " Heartwarming. Life-affirming. Reminiscent. Excited. These are just some of the words I can use to describe the experience of reading James Patterson and Matt Eversmann\u2019s THE SECRET LIVES OF BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS. It is not just a tribute to those in the book trade but a literary pat on the back to anyone who loves books. The Author\u2019s Note provides some eye-opening statistics about the current state of reading in this country. If you live in the US, you are among only one in five who can read a book and are actually in the habit of reading books. Only 15 percent of registered voters read books. It makes you believe that this beautiful pastime is on the brink of extinction. That is, until you check out the dozens of testimonies from book lovers that fill these pages. \"THE SECRET LIVES OF BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS is the best example of 'preaching to the choir' nonfiction reading that I can recall.... I applaud Patterson and Eversmann for doing the leg work and communicating with all of these book lovers to share their stories and views.\" Alexis Sky speaks of the smell of books and how guests to her independent bookstore in upstate New York often comment on it as they enter. You just don\u2019t get that scent when you visit one of the chain or big-box bookstores. She also reflects on her love of books and her supportive parents who allowed her to have her own library card. One day, their local librarian called with a friendly heads-up that Alexis had checked out an \u201cadult\u201d book. She asked her father what the word \u201cether\u201d meant and then went on to describe the journey that the two characters were undertaking in the novel she was reading. When he realized that she was referring to Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, she indicated that it was like ALICE IN WONDERLAND for boys. He concurred and told her that when she was older, they would have a different conversation about it. Lorrie Roussin is a middle school librarian from Texas. She surmises that this is the ideal place and perfect age for young people eager to explore the new worlds that reading opens up to them. They also are not as distracted as high school readers, who have so much more competing for their leisure time. Judy Blume, who is now 84 years old and the owner of a bookstore in Key West Florida, talks about the transition from book writer to bookseller. She feels that it is more important to share the wonder of reading with as many people as possible rather than locking herself away for years in the solitary exercise of writing a new novel. Susan Kehoe from Browseabout Books in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, discusses how she must ask non-book-related questions in job interviews to make sure that any prospective employee realizes that it is not all glamour. Her staff must be full-service to keep their doors open, and this includes cleaning the toilets and the daily task of sweeping up the sand that has been tracked in by patrons. What also makes independent bookstores unique are the occasional pets that become beloved fixtures there. Sally Brewster of Park Road Books in North Carolina recalls when a reporter contacted her to do a story --- not about the store, but about Yola, the extremely popular resident dog. Nancy Moore from Barnes & Noble in Massachusetts talks about how her love of books has become a way for her to pass judgment on people she meets. She is instantly suspicious of a home where no books are visible or on display. The big chain bookstores serve an important role in reaching readers where there are no other options. Jessica Claudio of Barnes & Noble in Staten Island, New York, is the owner of the only bookstore on the island. Therefore, it plays the same role that a smaller bookstore might serve for the residents as the only game in town. A neighborhood bookstore needs to reflect its community. This is seen at the Astoria Bookshop in Astoria, Queens. Owner and founder Lexi Beach fights an uphill battle to represent the oft-underrepresented borough in which she lives, especially in comparison to the more popular and artsy Brooklyn and Manhattan. People love to read local. Bookstores and libraries face the pressure of deciding what to make available on their shelves --- which is not an easy task when there is constant pressure from either the woke population or the government deciding what should be allowable. Denver librarian Dodie Ownes puts it best: \u201cIf we are going to carry THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK, then we also have to carry LGBTQ materials, and that also means that we have to carry something about Holocaust denial.\u201d The last bookseller I will cover is the store that is the most personal to me in this book. Sarah Galvin and her husband, Marc, run The Bookstore Plus in Lake Placid, NY. This town is an international Olympic village, and I began shopping there as a child. My sister, another avid reader, lives up there in the Adirondacks, and she attends this bookstore frequently. It makes me smile to know that it\u2019s still there and supporting local authors like Jamie Sheffield, who regrettably passed away last month. I wish that I could give time to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work. THE SECRET LIVES OF BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS is the best example of \u201cpreaching to the choir\u201d nonfiction reading that I can recall. It celebrates what we, the readers, love about the experience of reading a great and memorable book. The connections it makes within a community, as well as to our own memories and past experiences, are immeasurable. I applaud Patterson and Eversmann for doing the leg work and communicating with all of these book lovers to share their stories and views. It gives me hope for the continued future of the world\u2019s greatest way to pass the time. Reviewed by Ray Palen on April 13, 2024",

            "review": " While there is a death at the very beginning of THE STARS TURNED INSIDE OUT, Nova Jacobs has much more in store for readers than a typical murder mystery. This very sophisticated novel takes place in Switzerland. In the CERN facility, physicists try to divide atoms into smaller and smaller pieces in an effort to find dark matter, a mysterious concept that most of us don't fully understand, where the death takes place. And while the cause of death is clear, how it happened is not. The story is told in pieces, perhaps a nod to the pieces of matter that the physicists at CERN study. We learn about the \"Now,\" when the death is being investigated, and the \"Before,\" with both clearly labeled as to dates. We eventually realize that many of the players here are not who they appear to be. Eve Marsh works closely with fellow CERN physicist Arnav Bose, but she is torn. While she loves her job, she wonders how important it is when the world is in a climate crisis. In her few spare moments, she works on climate science, but the physicists' lives are pretty much devoted to being in the lab. \"[T]he ending is perfect and exceptionally touching. THE STARS TURNED INSIDE OUT certainly will leave you thinking about our world, the possibility of other worlds, and what really is important in life.\" As the novel progresses, we learn about the social lives of those who work at CERN, their happy hours, their coffee breaks, and the mysterious chateau in the woods where Stephen Hawking stayed. Most of the physicists are postdocs who are working there through the auspices of different universities, like Howard Anderby, to whom Eve is immediately drawn. Howard also has experienced loss --- in his case, the loss of not just one parent like Eve, but both. There's something a bit off about him, and it's important to find out exactly why he\u2019s different. Because it\u2019s his death that is featured in the book\u2019s opening pages. In addition to Eve's point of view, we learn about the events through Sabine Leroux\u2019s eyes. Sabine is a private investigator who has close ties to Yvonne Faye, who runs CERN, and Chlo\u00e9 Grimaud, who is one of the heads of a group. These three women were close friends at university, and those ties still bind. Another brilliant character is Niels Thorne, a flamboyant, extremely well-dressed physicist of means whose desperate goal is discovering dark matter. The other scientists are derisive about the fact that he spends more time giving tours than actually doing scientific work, but he's a likable man nonetheless in his immaculate jackets and scarves. Unlike most murder mysteries, this one doesn't leave clues dropped about like Gretel's scattered breadcrumbs. Instead, the story develops gradually as we find out more about the characters and particle physics. It's a subject that many of us know nothing about, so put on your researcher shoes and be prepared to learn at least something about the science that happens at CERN. Then there is a fascinating link between the study of physics and the metaphysical as Jacobs presents us with ideas relating to a universal consciousness and infinite alternate universes. When you finish the book, you might just do what I did and go back to reread some parts of it because of the information we didn't know until the end of the novel. A few crumbs scattered, after all. Between the scientific information, the buildup of the characters, a love story, the metaphysical and the mystery, there's a lot to digest. But the ending is perfect and exceptionally touching. THE STARS TURNED INSIDE OUT certainly will leave you thinking about our world, the possibility of other worlds, and what really is important in life. Reviewed by Pamela Kramer on March 22, 2024",

            "review": " THE STORM WE MADE, Vanessa Chan\u2019s debut novel, is a startling, gripping and electrifying exploration of the British colonization of Malaya and its subsequent Japanese occupation. It is February 1945, and the teenage boys of Bintang, Kuala Lumpur, are starting to disappear. Cecily Alcantara, a mother of three, has watched for years as her beloved homeland is first colonized by the British (who are domineering yet quiet) and then, in a bid for independence, occupied by the Japanese (who are much more involved than their colonizing peers). But despite revolutions and uprisings, guerrilla attacks and war, she and her family --- Gordon, her husband; Jujube, her serious eldest daughter; Abel, her loping, playful teenage son; and Jasmin, the cheer and whimsy of the family --- have remained safe and stable. Their safety is further ensured by their skin. Though they\u2019re not the blotchy pink of the British, Cecily and Gordon are of Eurasian descent, and they are able to \u201cpass\u201d between the worlds of the colonized and the colonizers. Until the day 15-year-old Abel doesn\u2019t come home. This would shock any mother; Cecily is fearful, devastated and frantic, but not surprised. After all, she carved the path for Abel\u2019s disappearance 10 years earlier, and the guilt has seen her through ever since. \"THE STORM WE MADE is a sweeping, unflinching portrayal of a country condemned.... This is a stunning achievement of wartime fiction, of Asian culture, and, most of all, of the ways in which war causes us to accept pain as part of existence.\" Jumping back to the British occupation, Chan introduces a younger, more privileged Cecily. Gordon, a consummate follower, has secured a good role in the British public works department. While Cecily has no love for her colonizers, she recognizes that Gordon\u2019s devotion at least keeps her family fed, clothed, sheltered and alive. But this doesn\u2019t mean that she can\u2019t --- under her stifling ball gowns, luxurious jewelry and picture-perfect fa\u00e7ade of composure --- dream of something more: an independent Malaya, taken as seriously as nations like China and Japan and able to rule and govern itself. One night, after her husband has passed out drunk, Cecily meets Bingley Chan, an Asian man who, with his British accent, seems to have secured a curious level of respect from the Brits. But Cecily learns that he is no follower. His real name is General Fujiwara, and she finds in him not only a sparkling conversationalist and upper-echelon-friendly confidant, but also an ally. Before long, Cecily is collecting scraps of paper from Gordon\u2019s office, lines of gossip from his parties and hushed whispers from behind the closed doors of her home, and delivering them all to Fujiwara. Together, they plan to confront and toss out the British, making way for the Japanese, whom Fujiwara claims will free Malaya. As Cecily turns from housewife to informant, she discovers both a new level of nationalism she didn\u2019t know she possessed and something even more powerful: a purpose. But 10 years later, Japan has taken over, boys --- including Abel --- are disappearing, girls are taken from their homes to act as \u201ccomfort women,\u201d and citizens like Cecily and Gordon have lost their purpose and pride. No longer at the frontline of the revolution, Cecily takes a backseat as her children become the new voices of invasion and occupation, starting with Abel, who is now living (unbeknownst to his family) in Kanchanaburi Labor Camp on the Thailand border. Abel\u2019s light skin and bright eyes are no longer a sign of privilege, but a target, and he is brutalized in more ways than one by his Japanese captors. Back at home, Jujube, now a young woman, works in a tea house serving battered soldiers and well-meaning but intrusive missionaries and educators, her only reprieve from her broken home. Unable to dream of a real future, she turns to safeguarding Jasmin, whose innocence both protects her from the horrors of war and puts her at serious risk. She knows nothing of labor camps or comfort women, only that she is forced to shear her hair and hide in the basement whenever soldiers are in town. In a moment of rage, she runs away. Now two of Cecily\u2019s children are missing; her husband, once a proud public figure, has been demoted to hard labor; and Cecily knows it is time to face her role in the turnover from British colonization to Japanese occupation. THE STORM WE MADE is a sweeping, unflinching portrayal of a country condemned. Vanessa Chan takes great risks in revealing the brutalities and violence of war, and it is obvious that her research into Malaya, an incredibly underexplored setting for wartime fiction, is both meticulous and compassionate. She chronicles truly horrifying moments, yet none of her more tragic scenes are ever voyeuristic or gratuitous. Every scene, piece of dialogue and development has been carefully considered, clearly conveyed and breathtakingly delivered. This is a stunning achievement of wartime fiction, of Asian culture, and, most of all, of the ways in which war causes us to accept pain as part of existence. The price of innocence --- as Chan so convincingly demonstrates through Jujube, Abel and Jasmin --- is never worth it, and it is even worse when children are forced to pay without ever knowing why. Even more bracing is Cecily\u2019s character arc, in which an act of revolution and liberation becomes a shackle, and the collateral damage of her dreams for more is personified by the abuse of her children. In writing THE STORM WE MADE, Chan has accomplished many things, one even more laudable than the next: a spellbinding, epic work of historical fiction, and a call to action for readers to expand their World War II reading to other countries and cultures, where the effects of war were no less felt but never truly acknowledged.

Rachel and Jaime: their story isn\u2019t simple. It might not even be their story. Augustus Fate, a once-lauded novelist and now renowned recluse, is struggling with his latest creation. But when Jaime and Rachel stumble into his remote cottage, he spies opportunity, imprisoning them inside his novel-in-progress. Now, the fledgling couple must try to find their way back home through a labyrinthine network of novels. And as they move from Victorian Oxford to a utopian Manchester, a harsh Russian winter to an AI-dominated near-future, so too does the narrative of their relationship change time and again. Together, they must figure out if this relationship of so many presents can have any future at all. THE WATERMARK is a heart-stopping exploration of the narratives we cling to in the course of a life, and the tendency of the world to unravel them. Kaleidoscopic and wildly imaginative, it asks: How can we truly be ourselves when Fate is pulling the strings?",

            "review": " Alice Robb was a student at the School of American Ballet in New York City during a period of relative calm. When she started taking lessons there (the feeder school for the New York City Ballet) in 2001, its founder, George Balanchine, had been dead for nearly 20 years. Still, the students and faculty would dress up and sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him, and many of the teachers considered themselves his disciples. \"DON'T THINK, DEAR will appeal to balletomanes and recovering dance students alike. Just as Robb does near the end of the book, readers will come away hopeful that perhaps this most rigid of art forms might finally become more flexible.\" But what really characterized the SAB and the NYCB, Robb contends, were darker remnants of Balanchine's approach, philosophy and methods. This included the essentially unattainable aesthetic ideal for his female dancers --- an insistence on an almost impossibly long, lean body, a small head, and feet with exaggerated arches. Anyone who has read much fiction or nonfiction about ballet (or watched films like\u00a0Black Swan) is no stranger to the extreme measures that serious dancers --- many of them young adolescents --- take as they strive for this aesthetic. But Robb goes farther than most, connecting their bodies not only to the pursuit for thinness but to their extreme tolerance for pain and their nearly supernatural level of spatial awareness. Robb also writes at length (and, for those of us who grew up idolizing NYCB ballerinas, with plenty of gossipy detail) about Balanchine's muses. Maria Tallchief, Suzanne Farrell and Gelsey Kirkland were the principal dancers who inspired his choreography, in many cases sharing his bed, and became household names. Robb chronicles the power dynamics at play in these women's lives and careers, and how those dynamics continued to shape expectations for ballet students like herself. The framing device for Robb's book is a photograph of herself and her SAB classmates, only a handful of whom went on to careers in dance. As Robb considers factors such as body image, injuries and romantic relationships swirling around the life of a competitive dancer, she checks in on those girls, now in their early 30s, to hear how they reflect on their training and discover how they've emerged from it. In some ways, DON'T THINK, DEAR resembles an addiction memoir. Some of Robb's subjects express relief that they got out before they could sustain too much damage. Others have done everything they could to stay in that world. Most agree that if they ever have daughters of their own, they'll discourage them from pursuing ballet. As for Robb herself, she has found joy in a profession --- writing --- that doesn't care if you've put on a pound or two or if your hair has fallen out of its bun. And she's taking tiny steps --- a bourr\u00e9e, if you will --- toward approaching ballet as something that might be freeing and even fun. DON'T THINK, DEAR will appeal to balletomanes and recovering dance students alike. Just as Robb does near the end of the book, readers will come away hopeful that perhaps this most rigid of art forms might finally become more flexible. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on March 3, 2023",

            "review": " Starting with the brutal murder of Oxford professor and art historian Charlotte Blake in an English coastal village, A DEATH IN CORNWALL soon expands into an international thriller whose protagonists cross Europe in search of the truth behind this perplexing death. Gabriel Allon, once an Israeli intelligence officer and now an art restorer who had lived in this same seaside village, is asked by the British police to help with the investigation. When he determines that the provenance of a Picasso painting is at the bottom of Charlotte\u2019s murder, Gabriel must follow the clues --- through Marseilles, Corsica, Monte Carlo and, finally, London. He is joined by a team of trusted operatives and colleagues, including Christopher Keller and Sarah Bancroft, whom readers of previous installments in the series will remember. \"While the term 'caper' might be used to describe the first half of this well-crafted suspense novel...the second half reveals a darker plot that seems ripped from the pages of recent international scandals.\" While the term \u201ccaper\u201d might be used to describe the first half of this well-crafted suspense novel --- as databases are hacked, villains are run off the road, and forged paintings are secreted into the high-security Geneva Freeport --- the second half reveals a darker plot that seems ripped from the pages of recent international scandals. It involves huge sums of money hidden behind shell companies and the billionaires and oligarchs who keep law firms and financial institutions afloat while politicians turn a blind eye. It also highlights the role that journalists play in revealing these machinations, which is no surprise given Daniel Silva\u2019s own background as a journalist and TV news producer. Meanwhile, longtime readers will notice that Gabriel Allon has evolved into a multidimensional character. While able to stay one step ahead of a swarm of antagonists, he has a solid reputation in the art world and a real affection and appreciation for his many friends there, as well as for his faithful allies and, of course, his family. Similarly, Silva effortlessly juggles a series of plot twists while homing in on a range of serious topics --- from the motivations of those who buy (and, in some cases, steal) art, to the role of dark money in many countries\u2019 finances and politics. A DEATH IN CORNWALL is the 24th entry in this\u00a0bestselling series and undoubtedly --- and deservedly --- will follow its predecessors to the #1 spot. Reviewed by Lorraine W.

            "review": " In the ruins of postwar Europe, the world's leading expert on the Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism goes on a hair-raising journey to recover sacred books stolen by the Nazis. At the end of the Second World War, Gershom Scholem, the magisterial scholar of Jewish mysticism, is commissioned by the Hebrew University in what was then British-ruled Palestine to retrieve a lost world. He is sent to sift through the rubble of Europe in search of precious Jewish books stolen by the Nazis or hidden by the Jews themselves in secret places throughout the ravaged continent. The search takes him into ruined cities and alien wastelands. The terrible irony of salvaging books that had outlasted the people for whom they\u2019d been written leaves Dr. Scholem longing for the kind of magic that had been the merely theoretical subject of his lamplit studies. Steve Stern's A FOOL\u2019S KABBALAH, a novel featuring numerous real-life historic figures, reimagines Gershom Scholem\u2019s quest and how it sparked in him the desire to realize the legacy of his dear friend, the brilliant philosopher Walter Benjamin. At the heart of that legacy was the idea that humor is an essential tool of redemption. In a parallel narrative, Menke Klepfisch, self-styled jester and incorrigible scamp, attempts to subvert, through his antic behavior, the cruelties of the Nazi occupation of his native village. As Menke\u2019s efforts collide with the monstrous reality of the Holocaust, we see --- in another place and time- --- evidence that Dr. Scholem, in defiance of his austere reputation, has begun to develop the anarchic characteristics of a clown. A FOOL'S KABBALAH intertwines the stories of these two quixotic characters, who, though poles apart, complement one another in their tragicomic struggles to oppose the supreme evil of history, using only the weapons of humor and a little magic.",

            "review": " What do you get when you combine a wildlife researcher's knowledge with a gripping plot and an admirable and likable protagonist? You get the books in Alice Henderson\u2019s highly acclaimed series, the third installment of which is A GHOST OF CARIBOU. In each title, Henderson cleverly uses the group noun for the animal that Alex Carter is researching. She wrote about \u201ca solitude of wolverines\u201d and \u201ca blizzard of polar bears\u201d in the first two entries, and now the focus shifts to caribou. In addition to the fine writing and the characters I have come to care about, I love learning about the wildlife. Caribou? I had no idea that we had them in the US until I read this thrilling novel. As a wildlife researcher for the Land Trust for Wildlife Conservation, Alex is responsible for investigating different species. This time, she is studying whether or not there is a caribou in Washington State; one might have been spotted on a remote camera. We are given a lot of info about caribou and how they differ from similar species like deer and elk. \"Have I enjoyed this series? Absolutely. Do I relish the action and the mystery, and learning about the environment with details I wouldn't otherwise encounter? Indubitably.\" Henderson never lectures, and the lessons, so to speak, are delivered naturally as part of the process of Alex\u2019s work. But we come to care about the animals, and it's extremely frustrating to see the futility of our Federal Endangered Species Act and its decades-long inability to protect species that are endangered but have not been formally listed. The bureaucratic process works so slowly and inefficiently that there is a real possibility that species will go extinct before anything significant is done. Henderson writes, \"The Endangered Species Act was a valuable piece of legislation, but Alex had come to believe that its approach might be outdated. It dealt with species as if they were isolated problems to solve. In reality, things needed to be addressed in a more holistic way. What we need is an Endangered Ecosystem Act, she thought. Protection that addressed an entire ecosystem would benefit so many species at once: wolverines, mountain caribou, the American pika, and, of course, even human.\" This especially resonates with people like me who have been watching the indiscriminate slaughter of wolves in Montana this hunting season. Henderson is passionate about our environment, and she emphasizes the damage that climate change is causing not just in terms of more destructive and uncontainable wildfires, hurricanes and warmer temperatures, but to the wildlife itself. She points out that we are \"currently experiencing an insect apocalypse that was going largely unreported. Insects had declined by 75 percent in the last fifty years, due to loss of habitat, pesticide use, and climate change.\" Then she explains why this devastation is so frightening. The mystery is well done. When Alex arrives at the land that the Trust has purchased, a dead body is found in town. She is asked to keep an eye out for a hiker who went missing the previous year as mysterious lights fly through the forest at night. One local is convinced that aliens are responsible, but knowing that Henderson is a scientist, we don\u2019t think that's where the story is headed. But there are times when we want to scream at Alex for taking unnecessary chances. She knows there is danger in the area yet stays out overnight. She also doesn't tell the local sheriff about the lights at first, and we're not sure why. The writing is engaging as Henderson describes the sights and aromas in the wild: \"Here, towering western red cedar and western hemlock trees grew to immense proportions, lichen hanging off their branches. The soil smelled damp and earthy, and she lingered, reveling in being out here in the mountains, the crisp air on her face.\" Have I enjoyed this series? Absolutely. Do I relish the action and the mystery, and learning about the environment with details I wouldn't otherwise encounter? Indubitably. Do I think that newcomers should read each book chronologically? Yes. That way, they truly will get to know Alex Carter's background and what she does, which will only add to their appreciation of the series. Reviewed by Pamela Kramer on December 3, 2022",

            "review": " A troubled teen named Libby has accused Maeve Cosgrove, a middle-aged Maine librarian, of spying on her in the library bathroom. Despite her protestations of innocence, Maeve loses her job. But then along comes Harrison Riddles, the author who Maeve had invited to talk at the library and finally has decided to accept. \"[T]his is a novel about the creative mind. Who better to explicate that than an author and his librarian?\" Riddles has another agenda, which is to write a novel about Maeve\u2019s Sudanese friend, Willie. In that pursuit, he seduces Maeve into becoming his go-between, therapist and, ultimately, lover. Adrift without her identity in a community where she was known first as a wife, then a mother and finally a beloved librarian, she\u2019s a willing accomplice. There are plenty of other characters wafting about these pages: Maeve\u2019s good-natured husband, Jack, who is conveniently out of town looking after his mother; Riddles\u2019 wife, who is working on a play and also is off-site; Willie\u2019s girlfriend, who is feeling increasingly de trop and anxious; and, sadly, Maeve and Jack\u2019s daughter, Paige, who seems to have left the nest for good. Much of BAD ANIMALS revolves around Riddles and his oft-voiced needs, but underlying those are Maeve\u2019s own needs that demand they be addressed as she tends to those around her. Sarah Braunstein is a deft writer, so everything in the book is used to effect as the plot (such as it is) unfolds. One could quibble at the endless conversations between Maeve and Riddles, or Maeve\u2019s obsessive focus on the teen who confronted her at the library. But, in the end, they help explain a lot. They illuminate each character\u2019s stated versus felt motivation, as well as how authors write and readers read. Both double back again to understand just what they\u2019re experiencing. After all, this is a novel about the creative mind. Who better to explicate that than an author and his librarian? Reviewed by Lorraine W. Shanley on April 6, 2024",

            "review": " It was such a treat to meet Antonia Scott, the unique and engaging crime fighter from the mind of Juan G\u00f3mez-Jurado, in RED QUEEN. It also was so much fun to watch the series on Prime Video, where the horrific crimes Antonia worked were brought to life. Now, Antonia and her partner in the Red Queen project, Jon Guti\u00e9rrez, are back on another case at the behest of their leader, Mentor. Antonia\u2019s brain is not wired like normal people. She can see and hear on multiple plains simultaneously, which makes it extremely difficult for any clue or motive to get past her. However, this skill set also has its drawbacks. She is constantly on special medications to regulate the bizarre things she sometimes visualizes, typically a bunch of wild monkeys. It has taken such a toll on her mentally that she takes solace in spending three solid minutes a day contemplating different ways of killing herself. \"This might be the first time in Antonia\u2019s life that she is truly scared because she is facing a foe who not only is ruthless but also appears to be completely soulless.\" At the start of BLACK WOLF, Antonia meets up with Jon, who has just fished out a female corpse from the Manzanares River in Madrid. As usual, she arrives a little late but quickly takes charge. She assesses the situation and starts to figure out what the first detective on the scene and the forensics squad failed to catch. Before they can get caught up in this investigation, Mentor lets Antonia and Jon know that they are being reassigned to another case six hours away that is a high priority. It also has something to do with the Russian mob, which is an ongoing battle that groups like the Red Queen project must face. A Russian group known as the Orlov Gang has gotten themselves into some sort of deadly feud that has left former police officer Anatoly Oleg Pastushenko dead as he was gunned down while guarding his boss\u2019s wife, Lola Moreno. Lola was married to Yuri Voronin, a big player in the Russian mob who was murdered in a separate incident. The very pregnant Lola is now on the run in her native Spain and is not sure who she can trust. Antonia and Jon are to immediately locate Lola and bring her in before she is silenced by whoever is attacking the Russian clan she married into as a young trophy wife. The individual who is spearheading this total elimination is not someone to be trifled with and has spared no expense in hiring a special assassin to finish the job by killing Lola --- a vicious executioner known only as Black Wolf. It might surprise some readers to learn that Black Wolf is a Russian female operative and assassin who has some things in common with Antonia. She is having trouble focusing due to the pain in her spine as the result of a mishap on a prior case. As such, the first time we see Black Wolf, she is waking up in a room in Madrid. It takes a bit of time before she realizes where she is. She then is visited by a man who proceeds to deliver painful injections into her lower back and spinal region that will provide her with the temporary relief necessary to complete her mission. G\u00f3mez-Jurado deftly sets up an extended version of cat-and-mouse that will ramp up each chapter until someone or several people are dead. Antonia has to use different skills in BLACK WOLF, like code-breaking and figuring out some of the shenanigans the Russian mob has been involved with regarding spyware, but nothing will prepare her for Black Wolf. This might be the first time in Antonia\u2019s life that she is truly scared because she is facing a foe who not only is ruthless but also appears to be completely soulless. This outstanding trilogy will wrap up with the release of WHITE KING, which I hope will be published as soon as possible. Hold on for another wild ride! Reviewed by Ray Palen on March 22, 2024",

            "review": " With over 19 million copies in print and a remarkable record of #1 New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today\u00a0and Publishers Weekly bestsellers, Bill O'Reilly's Killing series is the most popular series of narrative histories in the world. KILLING THE WITCHES revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women. Rumors of demonic possession and witchcraft consumed Salem. Soon three women were arrested under suspicion of being witches --- but as the hysteria spread, more than 200 people were accused. Thirty were found guilty, 20 were executed, and others died in jail or their lives were ruined. KILLING THE WITCHES tells the dramatic history of how the Puritan tradition and the power of early American ministers shaped the origins of the United States, influencing the founding fathers, the American Revolution and even the Constitutional Convention. The repercussions of Salem continue to the present day, notably in the real-life story behind The Exorcist and in contemporary \u201cwitch hunts\u201d driven by social media. The result is a compulsively readable book about good, evil, community panic, and how fear can overwhelm fact and reason.",

When Jess was 13, her mother went for a walk and never returned. Jess and her older sister, Liz, never found out what happened. Instead, they did what they hoped their mother had done: survive. As soon as she was old enough, Jess fled their small town of Knife River, wandering from girlfriend to girlfriend like a ghost in her own life, aimless in her attempts to outrun grief and confusion. But one morning, 15 years after their mother\u2019s disappearance, she gets the call she\u2019s been bracing for: Her mother\u2019s remains have been found. Jess returns to find Knife River --- and her sister --- frozen in time. The town is as claustrophobic and rundown as ever. Liz still lives in their childhood home and has become obsessed with unsolved missing persons cases. Jess plans to stay only until they get some answers, but their mother\u2019s bones, exposed to the elements for so long, just leave them with more questions. As Jess gets caught up in the case and falls back into an entanglement with her high school girlfriend, her understanding of the past, of Liz, of their mother and of herself become more complicated --- and the list of theories more ominous. KNIFE RIVER is a tense, intimate and heartrending portrayal of how deeply and imperfectly women love one another: in romantic relationships, in friendships and especially as sisters.",

            "review": " One of my favorite authors is the always reliable Jon Land, whose books combine top-flight thrills with intricately researched narratives. I was beyond excited to learn that he was teaming up with his friend, reviewer and author Jeff Ayers, to pen novels under the pseudonym A. J. Landau. This new series brings us something completely unique --- high-octane thrillers set in the world of the National Park Service. To kick it all off with the proper level of intensity, Landau has created an epic tragedy that could rival the horrific events of 9/11. In the Prologue, 15-year-old Danny Logan is visiting the Statue of Liberty with his parents and younger sister. He is recording their experience on his cell phone when he comes across something that seems odd to him. Having a superior knowledge of the boats used in the local fleet, he films one that is supposed to be out of commission. At the helm are a handful of men, one quite larger than the others, who appear suspicious and out of place. \"What makes LEAVE NO TRACE stand above similar thrillers is the use of the expert research I referred to earlier.... Huzzah, A. J. Landau, and here's hoping you are hard at work on the next Walker/Delgado adventure!\" Moments later, an explosion rocks the base of the Statue, knocking Lady Liberty down and burying hundreds of people in rubble. The final death toll will reach nearly a thousand. We then shift briefly to Virginia where Special Agent Michael Walker of the National Park Service is located. He receives an emergency call from his boss, Angela Pierce, who insists that he drop everything and head directly to Liberty Island in New York Harbor. The FBI is there as well, led by Assistant Special Agent Gina Delgado. There is the expected power play up front before Walker and Delgado decide to play nice with each other as they realize they are on the same side. This is mainly done because Delgado knows that Walker lost both his foot and his wife in a famous showdown that happened at a park out west. Even though Walker might not have the proper clearance for an event of this magnitude, he possesses an acute knowledge of the national parks, and his heroic reputation precedes him. Walker gets wind of Danny Logan, who is the only survivor from his family, and sees the video on the smashed cell phone. This could have been either an inside job or an act of domestic terrorism, which raises the threat scale significantly. It also indicates that this may not be the only attack at a prominent landmark planned for the continental US. When the experts at the FBI run Danny\u2019s footage, they get a match on the big man from the ship. It turns out he was an ex-military ops officer named Abel Rathman, who was listed as deceased in a helicopter crash years earlier, and the other men working with him were most likely members of his military team also listed as killed in duty. Walker and Delgado identify someone on the inside at Liberty Island who was working to help Rathman and his team. His name is Tom Fenton, and he is later found dead in his Queens apartment. Following a harrowing bit where Walker must save Danny\u2019s life as he is treated in a Manhattan hospital, he and Delgado are immediately called out to Philadelphia where the next potential terrorist act may be set for Independence Hall. Before readers are able to catch their breath, the pair jettison off to St. Louis where bombs have been placed inside the trams on the Gateway Arch. More causalities ensue, and the group behind these attacks are far from done. No national park or landmark is safe, and there does not seem to be enough people across the country to cover them all. I will not reveal the name or identity of the villainous team leader and his cohorts, but I can say that they have a massive cache of weapons hidden somewhere and an agenda that is extremely timely with our current political climate. Even the President herself is not safe from attack, as Delgado gets the call to provide protection in D.C. Meanwhile, Walker will end up facing off against an adversary from his infamous past, as well as another powerful figure he knows personally. What makes LEAVE NO TRACE stand above similar thrillers is the use of the expert research I referred to earlier. Each chapter is prefaced by a historical fact about whatever area is being detailed at that time --- and there are plenty in this story that hurtles at breakneck speed from the East Coast to the West Coast. Huzzah, A. J. Landau, and here's hoping you are hard at work on the next Walker/Delgado adventure! Reviewed by Ray Palen on March 2, 2024",

            "review": " Each year, there are debuts that impact readers. Occasionally, some of these titles earn year-end praise in the form of Best Debut Novel awards. MY NAME WAS EDEN by Eleanor Barker-White is a book that you should make note of, as I would not be surprised if this uniquely devised novel is remembered and honored when 2024 comes to a close. I have always been intrigued by stories involving twins. But Barker-White takes a different approach to this topic by placing an uncommon occurrence at the center of this dark and cunning psychological thriller. \"MY NAME WAS EDEN is the sort of creepy, deeply affecting novel that will invade your thoughts and dreams long after you have turned the stunning final pages.\" The creepy Prologue provides imagery of a nameless male figure who has been lurking in the shadows and is about to make himself known. This plays directly into the action of the story, which kicks off immediately when teenager Eden is discovered floating face down in the lake behind her farmhouse in the British countryside. Her mother, Lucy, screams for help, and initially it appears that she is dead. Incredibly, paramedics are able to revive Eden and get her to the hospital where she ends up making a full recovery. However, Eden is changed by this traumatic experience and not just physically. She starts claiming to her parents from her hospital bed that she was once Eden but is now Eli. This hits directly to Lucy\u2019s heart, as she had been carrying what looked like twins during her pregnancy years earlier, but just one child was left in her womb. The doctors referred to it as vanishing twin syndrome, where the stronger of the two fetuses absorbs the weaker one in the womb. Had Lucy given birth to twins, who had been identified by sonograms as female and male, they would have been named Eden and Eli. Lucy\u2019s husband, David, is not having any of this Eli nonsense and cannot understand why his daughter is using this name. Lucy\u2019s mother-in-law, Anna, does not give in to this new complication of identity and blames Lucy for Eden\u2019s near death in a passive-aggressive way. Nevertheless, everyone notices that things are different, especially the dynamic between Lucy and Eden. They never really got along before, but suddenly they are now close. Eden\u2019s return also leads to changes at school, specifically the relationship between her best friend, Charlie, and Charlie\u2019s crass boyfriend, Alex, whom Eden despises. When Alex dies after being struck by a vehicle, eyebrows are raised, and Lucy is directly involved in this tragic incident. Her strange behavior makes for many more complications, most of which are noticed only by Lucy. David is in avoidance mode not only because of his refusal to bow down to his daughter\u2019s insistence on being called Eli, but also out of guilt when it comes to an alleged affair that Lucy swears he is having with a younger coworker. Barker-White continues to infuse her book with mystery and suspense that is never predictable, even when you think you know where the story is taking you. MY NAME WAS EDEN is the sort of creepy, deeply affecting novel that will invade your thoughts and dreams long after you have turned the stunning final pages. I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us next! Reviewed by Ray Palen on March 9, 2024",

            "review": " From a writer of singular voice and vision, a mesmerizing epic that reimagines the past to explore the true nature of freedom. In this ingenious, sweeping novel, Phillip B. Williams introduces us to an enigmatic woman named Saint, a fearsome conjuror who, in the 1830s, annihilates plantations all over Arkansas to rescue the people enslaved there. She brings those she has freed to a haven of her own creation: a town just north of St. Louis, magically concealed from outsiders, named Ours. It is in this miraculous place that Saint\u2019s grand experiment --- a truly secluded community where her people may flourish --- takes root. But although Saint does her best to protect the inhabitants of Ours, over time, her conjuring and memories begin to betray her, leaving the town vulnerable to intrusions by newcomers with powers of their own. As the cracks in Saint\u2019s creation are exposed, some begin to wonder whether the community\u2019s safety might be yet another form of bondage. Set over the course of four decades and steeped in a rich tradition of American literature informed by Black surrealism, mythology and spirituality, OURS is a stunning exploration of the possibilities and limitations of love and freedom by a writer of capacious vision and talent.",
