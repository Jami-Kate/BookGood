        "review": " For fans of BEHOLD THE DREAMERS comes a compelling novel about a tightly bound Nigerian family living in Florida and the wounds that get passed down from generation to generation, from the author of the acclaimed MR. AND MRS. DOCTOR. When 276 schoolgirls are abducted from their school in Nigeria, Fidelis Ewerike, a Florida-based barrister, poet and former POW of the Nigerian Civil War, begins to go mad, consumed by memories of his younger sister, Ugochi, who went missing during that conflict. Consumed by survivor\u2019s guilt and fearful that the same fate awaits Amara, his 16-year-old daughter who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ugochi, Fidelis locks her in her bedroom, offering no words of explanation, only lovingly --- if poorly --- made meals and sweets. Amid that singular action, the Ewerike family spirals into chaos. After unsuccessful attempts to free her daughter from her room, his wife, Adaobi, seeks the counsel of a preacher, praying for spiritual liberation from the curse she is certain has plagued her family since leaving Nigeria. Fourteen-year-old Chuk, beset by his own war with the neighborhood boys, receives a painful education on force, masculinity, and his tenuous position within his family. And rebellious, resentful Amara is hungry for her life to be hers, so the moment she is able to escape her imprisonment, she falls in love --- not with the Aba-born engineer-in-training her mother envisages, but with Maksym Kostyk, the son of the town drunk. Before long, the two have concocted a plan to run away from the trappings of their familial traumas. Perfect for readers of SING, UNBURIED, SING, Julie Iromuanya's A SEASON OF LIGHT is an all-consuming masterpiece. To peer into the window of the Ewerike family\u2019s lives is a gift."

Professional baseball has featured a bevy of superstars over the past century and a half, but only a few of them have impacted their sport and cities as deeply as Willie McCovey and Billy Williams. Born just a handful of miles apart in 1938, they grew up in and around one of the sport\u2019s true cradles, Mobile, Alabama, on their way to producing two iconic careers in Major League Baseball. In A TIME FOR REFLECTION, Jason Cannon examines these two legends of the game. Overcoming the heinous racism of the Jim Crow South as part of the second generation of African American major leaguers who followed in the footsteps of Jackie Robinson, they became two of baseball\u2019s all-time greatest players. Off the field, they took impactful stands for racial progress that continue to resonate today. Their personal resolve, leadership in the clubhouse and dedication to their baseball communities endeared them to teammates and fans alike. Featuring original interviews with family members, friends, teammates and Williams himself, A TIME FOR REFLECTION brings to life their monumental accomplishments on the diamond, while also detailing how McCovey and Williams grew into pillars of San Francisco and Chicago and inspired future generations of ballplayers."

And anyone incurably obsessed with books understands this kind of unsettling literary encounter. Sarah calls books that have this effect \u201cLife Ruiners.\u201d Her Life Ruiner, Toni Morrison\u2019s THE BLUEST EYE, became a talisman for her in high school when its electrifying treatment of race exposed Sarah\u2019s deepest feelings about being Japanese American in a predominantly white suburb of Cleveland. But Sarah had always lived through her books, seeking escape, self-definition and rules for living. She built her life around reading, wrote criticism, and taught literature at an Ivy League University. Then she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown, and the world became an unreadable blank page. In the aftermath, she was faced with a question. Could we ever truly rewrite the stories that govern our lives? BIBLIOPHOBIA is an alternately searing and darkly humorous story of breakdown and survival told through books. Delving into texts such as ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, POSSESSION, A TALE FOR THE TIME BEING and THE LAST SAMURAI, Chihaya interrogates her cultural identity, her relationship with depression, and the intoxicating, sometimes painful, ways books push back on those who love them."

Birdie is keeping it together; of course she is. So she\u2019s a little hungover, sometimes, and she has to bring her daughter, Emaleen, to her job waiting tables at an Alaskan roadside lodge, but she\u2019s getting by as a single mother in a tough town. Still, Birdie can remember happier times from her youth, when she was free in the wilds of nature. Arthur Neilsen, a soft-spoken and scarred recluse who appears in town only at the change of seasons, brings Emaleen back to safety when she gets lost in the woods. Most people avoid him, but to Birdie, he represents everything she\u2019s ever longed for. She finds herself falling for Arthur and the land he knows so well. Against the warnings of those who care about them, Birdie and Emaleen move to his isolated cabin in the mountains, on the far side of the Wolverine River. It\u2019s just the three of them in the vast black woods, far from roads, telephones, electricity and outside contact, but Birdie believes she has come prepared. At first, it\u2019s idyllic and she can picture a happily ever after: Together they catch salmon, pick berries, and climb mountains so tall it\u2019s as if they could touch the bright blue sky. But soon Birdie discovers that Arthur is something much more mysterious and dangerous than she ever could have imagined and that like the Alaska wilderness, a fairy tale can be as dark as it is beautiful. BLACK WOODS, BLUE SKY is a novel with life-and-death stakes, about the love between a mother and daughter, and the allure of a wild life --- about what we gain and what it might cost us."

But decades ago, during the Urban Wars, he was part of a small, secret organization called The Twelve. Responding to an urgent summons from an old compatriot, he landed in New York and eased into the waiting car. And died within minutes. Lieutenant Eve Dallas finds the Rossi case frustrating. She has an elderly victim who just arrived from Rome; a widow who knows nothing about why he left; an as-yet unidentifiable weapon and zero results on facial recognition. But when she finds a connection to the Urban Wars of the 2020s, she thinks Summerset --- fiercely loyal, if somewhat grouchy, majordomo and the man who rescued her husband from the Dublin streets --- may know something from his stint as a medic in Europe back then. When Summerset learns of the crime, his shock and grief are clear --- because, as he eventually reveals, he himself was one of The Twelve. It\u2019s not a part of his past he likes to revisit. But now he must --- not only to assist Eve\u2019s investigation, but because a cryptic message from the killer has boasted that others of The Twelve have also died. Summerset is one of those who remain --- and the murderous mission is yet to be fully accomplished."

        "review": " What is the difference between men and women? Jennifer Finney Boylan, the bestselling author of SHE'S NOT THERE and co-author of MAD HONEY with Jodi Picoult, examines the divisions --- as well as the common ground --- between the genders and reflects on her own experiences, both difficult and joyful, as a transgender American. SHE'S NOT THERE was the first bestselling work written by a transgender American. Since its publication 20 years ago, Jennifer Finney Boylan has become the go-to person for insight into the impact of gender on our lives --- from the food we eat to the dreams we dream, both for ourselves and for our children. But CLEAVAGE is more than a deep dive into gender identity; it\u2019s also a look at the difference between coming out as trans in 2000 --- when many people reacted to Boylan\u2019s transition with love --- and the present era of blowback and fear. How does gender affect our sense of self? Our body image? The passage of time? The friends we lose --- and keep? Boylan considers her womanhood, reflects on the boys and men who shaped her, and reconceives of herself as a writer, activist, parent and spouse. With heart-wrenching honesty, she illustrates the feeling of liminality that followed her to adulthood, but demonstrates the redemptive power of love through it all. With Boylan\u2019s trademark humor and poignancy, CLEAVAGE is a sharp, witty and captivating look at the triumphs and losses of a life lived in two genders. It provides hope for a future in which we all have the freedom to live joyfully as men, as women and in the space between us."

Means, motive and a mountain of evidence leave everyone believing she\u2019s guilty. Everyone, that is, except Willowjean \u201cWill\u201d Parker, who knows for a fact her boss is innocent. She just doesn\u2019t know if she can prove it. With Lillian locked away in the House of D --- New York City\u2019s infamous women\u2019s prison --- Will is left to root out the real killer.

        "review": " A raw, beautiful memoir of a girl born missing an ear, a medical system insistent on saving her from herself, and our culture\u2019s desire to \u201cfix\u201d bodies. When Kate Gies was four years old, a plastic surgeon pressed a synthetic ear to the right side of her head and pulled out a mirror. He told her he could make her \u201cwhole\u201d --- could make her \u201cright\u201d --- and she believed him. From the ages of 4 to 13, she underwent 14 surgeries, including skin and bone grafts, to craft the appearance of an outer ear. Many of the surgeries failed, leaving permanent damage to her body. In short, lyrical vignettes, Kate writes about how her \u201cdisfigured\u201d body was scrutinized, pathologized and even weaponized. She describes the physical and psychic trauma of medical intervention and its effects on her sense of self, first as a child needing to be fixed and, later, as a teenager and adult navigating the complex expectations and dangers of being a woman. IT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL TO BE FINISHED is the story of a girl desperately trying to have a body that makes her acceptable and of a woman learning to own a body she has never felt was hers to define. In an age of speaking out about the abuse of marginalized bodies, this memoir takes a hard look at the role of the medical system in body oppression and trauma."

London, 1953. Louise is still adjusting to her postwar role as a housewife when she discovers a necklace in a box at a secondhand shop. The box is marked with the name of a department store in Paris, and she is certain she has seen the necklace before worked with the Red Cross in Nazi-occupied Europe --- and that it holds the key to the mysterious death of her friend Franny during the war. Following the trail of clues to Paris, Louise seeks help from her former boss Ian, with whom she shares a romantic history. The necklace leads them to discover the dark history of L\u00e9vitan --- a once-glamorous department store that served as a Nazi prison, and Helaine, a woman who was imprisoned there, torn apart from her husband when the Germans invaded France. Louise races to find the connection between the necklace, the department store and Franny\u2019s death. But nothing is as it seems, and there are forces determined to keep the truth buried forever. Inspired by the true story of L\u00e9vitan, LAST TWILIGHT IN PARIS is both a gripping mystery and an unforgettable story about sacrifice, resistance and the power of love to transcend in even the darkest hours."

        "review": " A heartrending and beautiful memoir of sudden loss and a journey towards peace, from the bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of\u202f HORSE. Many cultural and religious traditions expect those who are grieving to step away from the world. In contemporary life, we are more often met with red tape and to-do lists. This is exactly what happened to Geraldine Brooks when her partner of more than three decades, Tony Horwitz --- just 60 years old and, to her knowledge, vigorous and healthy --- collapsed and died on a Washington, D.C. sidewalk. After spending their early years together in conflict zones as foreign correspondents, Geraldine and Tony settled down to raise two boys on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The life they built was one of meaningful work, good humor and tenderness, as they spent their days writing and their evenings cooking family dinners or watching the sun set with friends at the beach. But all of this ended abruptly when, on Memorial Day 2019, Geraldine received the phone call we all dread. The demands were immediate and many. Without space to grieve, the sudden loss became a yawning gulf. Three years later, she booked a flight to a remote island off the coast of Australia with the intention of finally giving herself the time to mourn. In a shack on a pristine, rugged coast, she often went days without seeing another person. There, she pondered the various ways in which cultures grieve and what rituals of her own might help to rebuild a life around the void of Tony\u2019s death. A spare and profoundly moving memoir that joins the classics of the genre, MEMORIAL DAYS is a portrait of a larger-than-life man and a timeless love between souls that exquisitely captures the joy, agony and mystery of life."

When she meets Oscar Schmidt, a middle manager at a soap company, Vivian finds a partner she can guide to build the life she wants --- not least because, more interested in men himself, Oscar will leave Vivian to tend to her own romances with women. But Vivian's plans require capital, so the two pair up with Squire Clancey, scion of an old American fortune. Together they found Clancey & Schmidt, a preeminent manufacturer of soap, perfume and candles. When Oscar and Squire fall in love, the trio form a new kind of partnership.

Psychologist Alex Delaware and Homicide Detective Milo Sturgis race against time to find a twisted killer in this riveting thriller from the #1 New York Times bestselling \u201cmaster of suspense\u201d (Los Angeles Times). People come to Los Angeles to chase their dreams. Sometimes they find themselves cast into a nightmare. And sometimes, the most ardent dreamers turn out to be the most vicious monsters. The body of an aspiring actress is found dumped near a hospital emergency room. She\u2019s been drugged and murdered, and the motive for the callous crime remains maddeningly out of reach. Until a prime suspect materializes. Another Hollywood hopeful. Only to be shot dead by a sniper using a weapon that turns out to have been catalogued in a previous murder. And another before that. It\u2019s not long before more bodies begin piling up. What makes the murderous spree baffling is the apparent lack of connection among the victims. Is this the work of a random thrill killer, the toughest of all cases to unravel? But as Alex and Milo dig deeper they\u2019re faced with an even knottier scenario: a highly complex killer with deep-seated motivation that will require all of their highly honed skills to decipher. The latest page-turner from #1 New York Times bestseller Jonathan Kellerman is a tale of psychological complexity, dark suspense and shocking surprises. A wild ride through L.A.\u2019s surreal underbelly climaxed by an edge-of-the chair conclusion."

With one still in a German prison camp, the other wrote a book about it --- a memoir built on fabrications. Now the bestselling author of EIGHTY DAYS shares their incredible, never-before-told full story. Etta Shiber and Kate Bonnefous are the unlikeliest of heroines: two seemingly ordinary women, an American widow and an English divorc\u00e9e, living quietly together in Paris. Yet during the Nazi occupation, these two friends find themselves unexpectedly plunged into the whirlwind of history. With the help of a French country priest and others, they set out to rescue British and French soldiers trapped behind enemy lines --- some of whom they daringly smuggle through Nazi checkpoints hidden inside the trunk of their car. Ultimately the Gestapo captures them both. After 18 months in prison, Etta is returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange. Back home, hoping to bring attention to her friend Kitty\u2019s bravery, she publishes a memoir about their work. PARIS-UNDERGROUND becomes a publishing sensation and Etta a celebrity. Meanwhile, Kate spends the rest of the war in a Nazi prison, entirely unaware of the book that has been written about her --- and the deeds that have been claimed in her name. In researching this story, Matthew Goodman uncovered military records and personal testimonies that reveal, for the first time, the shocking truth behind Etta\u2019s memoir and the unexpected, far-reaching consequences of its publication. More than just a story of two women\u2019s remarkable courage, PARIS UNDERCOVER is a vivid, gripping account of deceit, betrayal and personal redemption."

Armed with this insight, she allows herself to look with the eye of an artist at the wounds she suffered and come to understand the transformational power this has to restore her soul. By turns candid and lyrical, stoic and forgiving, blunt and evocative, READING THE WAVES reframes memory to show how crucial this process can be to gaining a deeper understanding of ourselves."

William Boyle is the master of Brooklyn-set crime fiction, and SAINT OF THE NARROWS STREET is his magnum opus. For fans of \"The Sopranos,\" Jonathan Lethem and Dennis Lehane. Gravesend, Brooklyn, 1986: Risa Franzone lives in a ground-floor apartment on Saint of the Narrows Street with her bad-seed husband, Saverio, and their eight-month-old baby, Fabrizio. On the night Risa's younger sister, Giulia, moves in to recover from a bad breakup, a fateful accident occurs: Risa, boiled over with anger and fear, strikes a drunk, erratic Sav with a cast-iron pan, killing him on the spot. The sisters are left with a choice: notify the authorities and make a case for self-defense, or bury the man's body and go on with their lives as best they can. In a moment of panic, in the late hours of the night, they call upon Sav's childhood friend --- the sweet, loyal Christopher \"Chooch\" Gardini --- to help them, hoping they can trust him to carry a secret like this. Over the vast expanse of the next 18 years, life goes on in the working-class Italian neighborhood of Gravesend as Risa, Giulia, Chooch and eventually Fabrizio grapple with what happened that night. A standout work of character-driven crime fiction from a celebrated author of the form, SAINT OF THE NARROWS STREET is a searing and richly drawn novel about the choices we make and how they shape our lives."

In the tradition of EVICTED and INVISIBLE CHILD, Jeff Hobbs masterfully explores America\u2019s housing crisis through the real-life story of Evelyn. This is Hobbs\u2019 first book since THE SHORT AND TRAGIC LIFE OF ROBERT PEACE that focuses on a single character and her extraordinarily illuminating journey. In 2018, poverty and domestic violence cast Evelyn and her children into the urban wilderness of Los Angeles, where she avoids the family crisis network that offers no clear pathway for her children to remain together and in a decent school. For the next five years, Evelyn works full time as a waitress yet remains unable to afford legitimate housing or qualify for government aid. All the while she strives to provide stability, education, loving memories and college aspirations for her children even as they sleep in motels and in her car, living in fear of both her ex and the nation\u2019s largest child welfare agency. Eventually Evelyn encounters Wendi Gaines, a recently trained social worker who decades earlier survived her own abusive marriage and housing crisis. Evelyn becomes one of Wendi\u2019s first clients, and the relationship transforms them both. Told from the perspectives of Evelyn, Wendi, and Evelyn\u2019s teenage son, Orlando, SEEKING SHELTER is a powerful and urgent exploration of the issues of homelessness, poverty and education in America --- a must-read for anyone interested in understanding not just social inequality and economic disparity in our society but also the power of a mother\u2019s love and vision for her kids."

With illustrations by Forsyth Harmon. A taxonomy of sweetness, a rhapsody of artificial flavors, and a multi-faceted theory of pleasure, SWEET NOTHINGS is made up of 100 illustrated micro essays organized by candy color, from the red of Pop Rocks to the purple Jelly Bonbon in the Whitman\u2019s Sampler. Each entry is a meditation on taste and texture, a memory unlocked. Everyone\u2019s favorites --- and least favorites --- are carefully considered, including Snickers and Trader Joe\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, as well as the beloved Good n\u2019 Plenty and Werther\u2019s Originals. An expert guide and exquisite writer, Sarah Perry asks such pressing questions as: Twizzlers or Red Vines? Why are Mentos eaters so maniacally happy? And in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, how could Edmund sell out his siblings for, of all things, Turkish delight? She rejects the dreaded \u201cWhat is your favorite candy?\u201d question and counters: Under what circumstances? The question itself is flawed --- favorite under what circumstances? In what weather? On the road, or at home? In what mood? For candy is inextricably tied to the seasons of our lives. SWEET NOTHINGS moves associatively, touching on pop culture, art, culinary history, philosophy, body image and class-based food moralism. It challenges the very idea of \u201cjunk\u201d food and posits taking pleasure seriously as a means of survival. Sarah Perry\u2019s pure love of candy weaves together elegiac glimpses of her '90s childhood --- and the loss at its center --- with stories of love and desire. Surprisingly smart and frequently funny, SWEET NOTHINGS is a tart and sweet ode to finding small joys where you can. Yes, even in black licorice."

Strays, Mama calls them. People who have strayed too far from the road. Mama loves the strays. She feeds them wine and keeps them warm. Then she satisfies her burning appetite by picking apart their bodies. But Mama\u2019s want is stronger than her hunger sometimes.

And no one is more sympathetic than a mother whose child faces a life-threatening illness. But what if the mother is the cause of the illness? What if the sympathy is the point? Munchausen by proxy (MBP) has fascinated and horrified both professionals and the general public since this disturbing form of child abuse was first identified. But even as the public has been captivated by these tales of abuse and deception, there remains widespread misinformation and confusion about MBP. Are these mothers unfeeling psychopaths, or sick women who need help? And more important, how can we protect the children whose lives are at stake? THE MOTHER NEXT DOOR offers a groundbreaking look at MBP from an unlikely duo: a Seattle novelist whose own family was torn apart by it, and the Texas detective who has worked on more medical child abuse cases than anyone in the nation. Readers ride along on three high-stakes MPB investigations; through riveting reporting and shocking stories from the family members, friends and doctors caught in the blast zone of these unthinkable acts, a twisted portrait of motherhood and deceit is revealed. With help from some of the top MBP experts in the world, Dunlop and Weber uncover the complex maze of psychological, systemic and cultural issues that compound MBP and offer solutions for how we might find our way out."

A couple for 30 years, their \"separate but together\" partnership is running up against the realities of late middle age: Grant\u2019s mother has died, the college where he taught philosophy was shuttered, and their twin girls are grown and gone. Escaping the bitter cold of a Midwestern winter for the hot desert sun of Palm Springs seems as good a solution as any to the more intractable problems they face. When they arrive at Le Desert, a quirky condo community where everyone knows everyone\u2019s business, Kim immediately embraces the opportunity to make new friends and explore a more adventurous side of her personality. Meanwhile, Grant struggles to find his footing in this unfamiliar landscape, leaving Kim to wonder if their relationship can survive the snowbird season. But when Grant goes missing on a hike in the Palm Springs mountains, Kim is forced to consider two terrifying outcomes: either Grant is truly lost, or this time, he\u2019s really left her. Is it ever too late to become the person we wanted to be --- and is there still time to change into someone better? The exhilarating but often confusing transitions of midlife are pitched against the promise and glamour of Palm Springs in this tender, honest story of what it takes to commit to someone for a lifetime. With compassion and humor, Clancy explores the redemptive power of finding ourselves, and of being found."

They came alone when they needed to get away from each other, and together when they had something important to discuss. The Park has been their witness for half a century of love. Until now. Jane is dying, and Abe is recounting their life together as a way of keeping them going: the parts they knew --- their courtship and early marriage, their blossoming creative lives --- and the parts they didn\u2019t always want to know --- the determined young student of Abe\u2019s looking for a love story of her own, and their son, Max, who believes his mother chose art over parenthood and who has avoided love and intimacy at all costs. Told in various points of view, even in conversation with Central Park itself, these voices weave in and out to paint a portrait as complicated and essential as love itself. An homage to New York City, to romance and even to loss, THIS IS A LOVE STORY tenderly and suspensefully captures deep truths about life and marriage in radiant prose. It is about love that endures despite what life throws at us, or perhaps even because of it."

Grim Wolds, England: Winifred Notty arrives at Ensor House prepared to play the perfect governess.

        "review": " For fans of AFTERSHOCKS and HOW TO SLOWLY KILL YOURSELF AND OTHERS IN AMERICA, a gripping and deeply honest memoir in essays, this debut collection sets out to answer the universal question of: Why am I like this? When Theresa Okokon was nine, her father traveled to his hometown in Nigeria to attend his mother\u2019s funeral\u2026and never returned. His mysterious death shattered Theresa as her family\u2019s world unraveled. Now a storyteller and television cohost, Okokon sets out to explore the ripple effects of that profound loss and the way heartache shapes our sense of self and of the world --- for the rest of our lives. Using her grief and her father\u2019s death as a backdrop, Okokon delves deeply into intrinsic themes of Blackness, African spirituality, family, abandonment, belonging, and the seemingly endless, unrequited romantic pursuits of a Black woman who came of age as a Black girl in the Wisconsin suburbs where she was --- in many ways --- always an anomaly."

It's 2004, and former reality TV star and party girl Maya Miller has just married the most eligible bachelor on the planet: Colin Sterling, of the globally famous Sterling family, whose history of aristocratic titles and land holdings rival a British royal and whose media empire is comparable to the Murdochs. To some, Maya represents the American dream. To others, a gold digger. But when Colin's cousin Arianna, the heiress to the family's immense fortune, is found murdered, Maya is thrust into the spotlight: first as she is revealed to be the next heiress to the fortune, and then as the prime suspect. Swiftly, the entire Sterling family goes into lockdown at Silver House, the family's ancestral estate in the English countryside. They're told it's for their own safety --- but Maya becomes convinced that it's not to keep threats out, but to keep secrets in. Now, she has no choice but to find and expose the truth hidden within the Sterling family, and why Arianna, a girl she had never met, chose her to take her place. But Maya has secrets of her own. And she knows that in order to survive the Sterlings, she'll have to beat them at their own game."

        "review": " Two brothers in dire straits, living on the edge of Yellowstone, agree to a desperate act of survival in this taut, propulsive novel reminiscent of the works of Peter Heller and Donald Ray Pollock. In an aging timber house hand-built into the Absaroka-Beartooth mountains, two brothers are struggling to keep up with their debts. They live off the grid, on the fringe of Yellowstone, surviving off the wild after the death of their father. Thad, the elder, is more capable of engaging with things like the truck registration, or the medical bills they can\u2019t afford from their father\u2019s fatal illness, or the tax lien on the cabin their grandfather built, while Hazen is\u2026different, more instinctual, and deeply in tune with the natural world. Desperate for money, they are approached by a shadowy out-of-towner with a dangerous proposition that will change both of their lives forever. BEARTOOTH is a fast-paced tale with moments of surprising poignancy set in the grandeur of the American West. Evoking the timeless voices of American pastoral storytelling, this is a bracing, masterful novel about survival, revenge and the bond between brothers."

By all accounts, Carl and Roy Opgard are doing quite well for themselves. Or at least they\u2019re doing as well as can be expected in a small town like Os. Carl manages the area\u2019s swanky and successful spa and hotel, while Roy runs a nearby gas station and harbors grand plans to build it out into an entire amusement park, complete with a roller coaster. But when news breaks about a new highway to be built nearby, bypassing Os and leaving the town cutoff and isolated, it\u2019s clear that something has to be done\u2026even if the methods are bound to be dirty. Fortunately, Carl and Roy have experience with just that kind of work. Meanwhile, the town sheriff has gotten his hands on new technology that will enable him to take a deeper look at a slate of unsolved murders from years past --- including that of his own father. And just as the sheriff reopens his investigation, the death toll begins to climb. It\u2019s like Roy says about his roller coaster: \u201cOnce it\u2019s rolling, it\u2019s too late to get off.\u201d BLOOD TIES is a tense, compulsively readable tour de force about loyalty, family ties and love that is as destructive as it is powerful."

Prudence Wright seems to have it all: a loving husband, Davis; a spacious home in Washington, D.C.; and the former glories of a successful career at McKinsey, which now enables her to dedicate her days to her autistic son, Roland. When she and Davis head out for dinner with one of Davis\u2019 new colleagues on a stormy summer evening filled with startling and unwelcome interruptions, Prudence has little reason to think that certain details of her history might arise sometime between cocktails and the appetizer course. Yet when Davis\u2019 colleague turns out to be Matshediso, a man from Prudence\u2019s past, she is transported back to the formative months she spent as a law student in South Africa in 1996. As an intern at a Johannesburg law firm, Prudence attended sessions of the Truth and Reconciliation hearings that uncovered the many horrors and human rights abuses of the Apartheid state, and which fundamentally shaped her sense of righteousness and justice. Prudence experienced personal horrors in South Africa as well, long hidden and now at risk of coming to light. When Matshediso finally reveals the real reason behind his sudden reappearance, he will force Prudence to examine her most deeply held beliefs and excavate inner reserves of resilience and strength. Lauren Francis-Sharma\u2019s previous two novels have established her as a deft chronicler of history and its intersections with flawed humans struggling to find peace in unjust circumstances. With keen insight and gripping tension, CASUALTIES OF TRUTH explosively mines questions of whether we are ever truly able to remove the stains of our past and how we may attempt to reconcile with unquestionable wrongs."

Lingering at the edge of a family party, a troop of cousins loses track of the youngest child among them. With their parents preoccupied with bickering about decades-old crises, the children decide they must set out to investigate themselves --- to the rickety chicken coop, the barn and its two troublesome horses, and into the woods that once comprised their late grandmother\u2019s property. The more the children search, and the deeper they walk, the more threatening the woods become and the more lost they are, caught between their aunt\u2019s home in the present day, their parents\u2019 childhood home just through the trees and the memory of the house their grandmother grew up in. Soon, what began as a quest for answers gives way to a journey that undermines everything they\u2019ve been told about who they are, where they came from and what they deserve. Disquieting and delightful, IDLE GROUNDS is a rich exploration of the interior lives of children and a gripping meditation on birthright, decline and weight of family history. A fable of the distortions of privilege and the impossibility of keeping secrets hidden, this is a novel about straying from home --- only to come back unraveled, unsettled and irrevocably changed."

Perfect for readers of Brit Bennett and Tayari Jones. Two women. Two pivotal moments. One dream for justice and equality. In the fall of 1959, Freda Gilroy arrives on the campus of Fisk University full of hope, carrying a suitcase and the voice of her father telling her she\u2019s part of a family legacy of greatness. Soon, the ugliness of the Jim Crow South intrudes, and she\u2019s thrust into a movement for social change. Freda is reluctant to get involved, torn between a soon-to-be doctor her parents approve of and an audacious young man willing to risk it all in the name of justice. Freda finds herself caught between two worlds, and two loves, and must decide how much she\u2019s willing to sacrifice for the advancement of her people. In 1992 Chicago, Freda\u2019s daughter, Tulip, is an ambitious PR professional on track for an exciting career, if workplace politics and racial microaggressions don\u2019t get in her way. But with the ruling in the Rodney King trial weighing heavily on her, Tulip feels called to action. When she makes an irreversible professional misstep as she seeks to uplift her community, she must decide, just like her mother had three decades prior, what she\u2019s willing to risk in the name of justice and equality. Insightful, evocative and richly imagined with stories of hidden history, PEOPLE OF MEANS is an emotional tour de force that offers a glimpse into the quest for racial equality, the pursuit of personal and communal success, and the power of love and family ties."

The victim is Spencer Bennett, a junior law associate with the Waterford Group, and he supposedly had a file of confidential documents on him when he died. But those documents have now gone missing, and the firm is dead set on Walker finding them. As Walker digs deeper into the events leading to Bennett's death, all signs are pointing towards the crash being anything but accidental. Summer in Detroit was hot enough before the smoke descended, but as the temperature rises and more bodies crop up in connection to the missing file, Walker will have to track down those documents --- and unearth why they were worth killing over --- before it's too late."

CHRISTIE returns with a thrilling story of Agatha Christie\u2019s legendary rival, Dorothy Sayers; the race to solve a murder; and the power of friendship among women. London, 1930. The five greatest women crime writers have banded together to form a secret society with a single goal: to show they are no longer willing to be treated as second-class citizens by their male counterparts in the legendary Detection Club. Led by the formidable Dorothy L. Sayers, the group includes Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham and Baroness Emma Orczy. They call themselves the Queens of Crime. Their plan? Solve an actual murder, that of a young woman found strangled in a park in France who may have connections leading to the highest levels of the British establishment. May Daniels, a young English nurse on an excursion to France with her friend, seemed to vanish into thin air as they prepared to board a ferry home. Months later, her body is found in the nearby woods. The murder has all the hallmarks of a locked-room mystery for which these authors are famous. How did her killer manage to sneak her body out of a crowded train station without anyone noticing? If, as the police believe, the cause of death is manual strangulation, why is there an extraordinary amount of blood at the crime scene? What is the meaning of a heartbreaking secret letter seeming to implicate an unnamed paramour? Determined to solve the highly publicized murder, the Queens of Crime embark on their own investigation, discovering they\u2019re stronger together. But soon the killer targets Dorothy Sayers herself, threatening to expose a dark secret in her past that she would do anything to keep hidden. Inspired by a true story in Sayers\u2019 own life, New York Times bestselling author Marie Benedict brings to life the lengths to which five talented women writers will go to be taken seriously in the male-dominated world of letters as they unpuzzle a mystery torn from the pages of their own novels."

        "review": " In her debut collection of short fiction, Amanda Peters describes the Indigenous experience from an astonishingly wide spectrum in time and place --- from contact with the first European settlers, to the forced removal of Indigenous children, to the present-day fight for the right to clean water. In this intimate collection, Amanda Peters melds traditional storytelling with beautiful, spare prose to describe the dignity of the traditional way of life, the humiliations of systemic racism and the resilient power to endure. A young man returns from residential school only to realize he no longer can communicate with his own parents. A grieving mother finds purpose and healing on the front lines as a water protector. And a nervous child dances in her first Mawi\u2019omi. The collection also includes the Indigenous Voices Award-winning and title story \u201cWaiting for the Long Night Moon.\u201d At times sad, sometimes disturbing but always redemptive, the stories in WAITING FOR THE LONG NIGHT MOON will remind you that where there is grief there is also joy, where there is trauma there is resilience and, most importantly, there is power."

Her career is in freefall, and her love life is\u2026complicated. So when Lila\u2019s real dad --- a man she barely has seen since he ran off to Hollywood 35 years ago --- suddenly appears on her doorstep, it feels like the final straw. But it turns out even the family you thought you could never forgive might have something to teach you: about love, and what it actually means to be family."

No one appears more surprised than Hailey Gelman when she comes under suspicion for the murder of her soon-to-be ex-husband, Jonah. Hailey --- nicknamed Sunshine by her mother for her bright outlook and ever-present smile --- has always tried to do what is expected of her and is regarded as the family peacemaker. But is anyone, including Hailey, who she has always seemed to be? The months leading up to Jonah\u2019s death have been fraught, including a bitter separation and a messy custody battle over their young daughter, Maya. When Hailey files a motion to relocate to Florida so she can be near her family, Jonah retaliates and the divorce begins to spiral dangerously out of control. Sherry, Hailey\u2019s mother, will stop at almost nothing to keep Jonah from getting what he wants. Nate, Hailey\u2019s impetuous and protective older brother, has tried to keep his distance, but he can\u2019t stand to see his little sister suffer. And then there\u2019s Solomon, the patriarch, who is keeping a secret that threatens the stability and security Sherry has worked so hard to maintain. Soon, they are forced to reckon with who they are as individuals and as a family, and just how far they will go for each other. Inspired by a true story, WE WOULD NEVER is a gripping mystery, an intimate family drama, and a provocative exploration of loyalty, betrayal, and the blurred line between protecting and forsaking the ones we love most."

        "review": " From rare book dealer and guest star of the hit show \"Pawn Stars,\" a page-turning literary adventure that introduces readers to the women writers who inspired Jane Austen --- and investigates why their books have disappeared from our shelves. Long before she was a rare book dealer, Rebecca Romney was a devoted reader of Jane Austen. She loved that Austen\u2019s books took the lives of women seriously, explored relationships with wit and confidence, and always allowed for the possibility of a happy ending. She read and reread them, often wishing Austen wrote just one more. But Austen wasn\u2019t a lone genius. She wrote at a time of great experimentation for women writers --- and clues about those women, and the exceptional books they wrote, are sprinkled like breadcrumbs throughout Austen\u2019s work. Every character in NORTHANGER ABBEY who isn\u2019t a boor sings the praises of Ann Radcliffe. The play that causes such a stir in MANSFIELD PARK is a real one by the playwright Elizabeth Inchbald. In fact, the phrase \u201cpride and prejudice\u201d came from Frances Burney\u2019s second novel, CECILIA. The women who populated Jane Austen\u2019s bookshelf profoundly influenced her work; Austen looked up to them, passionately discussed their books with her friends, and used an appreciation of their books as a litmus test for whether someone had good taste. So where had these women gone? Why hadn\u2019t Romney --- despite her training --- ever read them? Or, in some cases, even heard of them? And why were they no longer embraced as part of the wider literary canon? JANE AUSTEN'S BOOKSHELF investigates the disappearance of Austen\u2019s heroes --- women writers who were erased from the Western canon --- to reveal who they were, what they meant to Austen, and how they were forgotten. Each chapter profiles a different writer, including Frances Burney, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Lennox, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, Elizabeth Inchbald, Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi and Maria Edgeworth --- and recounts Romney\u2019s experience reading them, finding rare copies of their works and drawing on connections between their words and Austen\u2019s. Romney collects the once-famed works of these forgotten writers, physically recreating Austen\u2019s bookshelf and making a convincing case for why these books should be placed back on the to-be-read pile of all book lovers today. JANE AUSTEN'S BOOKSHELF will encourage you to look beyond assigned reading lists, question who decides what belongs there, and build your very own collection of favorite novels."

Over the 50 years that Lorne Michaels has been at the helm of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d he has become a revered and inimitable presence in the entertainment world. He\u2019s a tastemaker, a mogul, a withholding father figure, a genius spotter of talent, a shrewd businessman, a name-dropper, a raconteur, the inspiration for Dr. Evil, the winner of more than a hundred Emmys --- and, essentially, a mystery.

With unprecedented access to Michaels and the entire \u201cSNL\u201d apparatus, Susan Morrison takes readers behind the curtain for the lively, up-and-down, definitive story of how Michaels created and maintained the institution that changed comedy forever. Drawn from hundreds of interviews --- with Michaels, his friends, and SNL\u2019s iconic stars and writers, from Will Ferrell to Tina Fey to John Mulaney to Chris Rock to Dan Aykroyd --- LORNE is a deeply reported, wildly entertaining account of a man singularly obsessed with the show that would define his life and have a profound impact on American culture."

On a bright spring afternoon, Ciara Fay makes a split-second decision that will change everything. Grabbing an armful of clothes off the clothesline, she straps her two young daughters into her car and drives away. Head spinning, all she knows for certain is that home is no longer safe --- and that this time, when she leaves, she must stay away. On the surface, she has a perfect life. Her husband, Ryan, is a good provider, sometimes even kind and attentive, from a nice Irish family and they have another baby on the way. But he also monitors Ciara's every move, flies into unpredictable rages where he convinces her she can do nothing right, and has isolated her from work, friends and her beloved family. Was fleeing the right thing to do? With no job and no support, Ciara struggles to provide a sense of normalcy for her little girls. Facing a broken housing system, they move into a hotel room on a floor reserved for women like her --- eating takeout, washing their clothes in the bathroom sink, and building a community with the other residents. Ryan, meanwhile, wages a relentless campaign to win her back, and Ciara wavers. He never hit her, after all, and don't the girls need a stable home? For fans of Claire Keegan and Louise Kennedy, Rois\u00edn O'Donnell\u2019s extraordinary debut creates a devastating and suspenseful portrait of gaslighting and emotional abuse --- and, even better, a triumphant story about family, love and finding a new place to nest."

The year is 1986. The city is San Francisco. Here, Martin Hench will invent the forensic accountant --- what a bounty hunter is to people, he is to money --- but for now he's an MIT dropout odd-jobbing his way around a city still reeling from the invention of a revolutionary new technology that will change everything about crime forever, one we now take completely for granted. When Marty finds himself hired by Silicon Valley PC startup Fidelity Computing to investigate a group of disgruntled ex-employees who've founded a competitor startup, he quickly realizes he's on the wrong side. Marty ditches the greasy old guys running Fidelity Computing without a second thought, utterly infatuated with the electric atmosphere of Computing Freedom. Located in the heart of the Mission, this group of brilliant young women found themselves exhausted by the predatory business practices of Fidelity Computing and set out to beat them at their own game, making better computers and driving Fidelity Computing out of business. But this optimistic startup, fueled by young love and California-style burritos, has no idea the depth of the evil they're seeking to unroot or the risks they run. In this company-eat-company city, Martin and his friends will be lucky to escape with their lives."

When the stones of her house begin to rattle and shift and call out mysterious messages to her in the middle of the night, Pauline Sinclair, age 99, knows she will not make it to her 100th birthday. She has lived a modest life in Mason Hall, a rural Jamaican village, educating herself with stolen books, raising her two children, surviving by becoming a successful ganja farmer in the area and experiencing both deep passion and true loss with her beloved baby father, Clive. Behind this seemingly benign fa\u00e7ade, however, Miss Pauline has buried many secrets. To avenge her enslaved ancestors, she has built her house, stone by stone, from the ruins of a plantation on her land. And she knows more than she has told about the disappearance of Turner Buchanan --- a white American man who came to Mason Hall decades ago to claim her land. The whispering stones, Miss Pauline realizes, are telling her that she must make peace with the past before she dies. With help from her American granddaughter, Justine, and Lamont, a teenager she enlists to help her navigate the mysteries of the Internet, she searches for those she has wronged. But as the people and stories of her past come to invade her present, she discovers that there are shocking secrets even she could not have anticipated. Lyrical, funny, eerie and profound, infused with the patois and natural beauty of Jamaica,\u00a0A HOUSE FOR MISS PAULINE\u00a0tells a timely and nuanced story about identity, colonialism and land --- and introduces an unforgettable heroine who is a model for living life on her own terms."

        "review": " From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of LILIANA'S INVISIBLE SUMMER, a dreamlike, genre-defying novel about a professor and detective seeking justice in a world suffused with gendered violence. A city is always a cemetery. A professor named Cristina Rivera Garza stumbles upon the corpse of a mutilated man in a dark alley and reports it to the police. When shown a crime scene photo, she finds a stark warning written in tiny print with coral nail polish on the brick wall beside the body: \u201cBeware of me, my love / beware of the silent woman in the desert.\u201d The professor becomes the first informant on the case, which is led by a detective newly obsessed with poetry and trailed by a long list of failures. But what has the professor really seen? As the bodies of more castrated men are found alongside lines of verse, the detective tries to decipher the meaning of the poems to put a stop to the violence spreading throughout the city. Originally written in Spanish, where the word \u201cvictim\u201d is always feminine, DEATH TAKES ME is a thrilling masterpiece of literary fiction that flips the traditional crime narrative of gendered violence on its head. As sharp as the cuts on the bodies of the victims, it unfolds with the charged logic of a dream, moving from the police station to the professor\u2019s classroom and through the slippery worlds of Latin American poetry and art in an imaginative exploration of the unstable terrains of desire and sexuality."

It\u2019s a Friday night in a campus bar in Berkeley, fall of 2000 and Percy Marks is pontificating about music again. Hall and Oates is on the jukebox and Percy --- who has no talent for music, just lots of opinions about it --- can\u2019t stop herself from overanalyzing the song, indulging what she knows to be her most annoying habit. But something is different tonight. The guy beside her at the bar, fellow student Joe Morrow, is a songwriter. And he could listen to Percy talk all night. Joe asks Percy for feedback on one of his songs --- and the results kick off a partnership that will span years, ignite new passions in them both and set Joe on a path to indie-rock stardom. But it also bruises Joe\u2019s ego and traps Percy in a role she resents. How long can Percy ignore the roars of her heart and of her own unique talent, to protect their thrilling collaboration? Moving from Brooklyn bars to San Francisco dancefloors, DEEP CUTS examines the nature of talent, obsession, belonging and above all, our need to be heard."

When they married Emperors Franz Joseph and Napoleon III, respectively, Elisabeth of Austria and Eug\u00e9nie of France became two of the most famous women on the planet.

Between them, Elisabeth and Eug\u00e9nie were personally involved in every major international confrontation in their turbulent century, which witnessed thrilling technological advances, as well as revolutions, assassinations and wars. With her characteristic in-depth research and jump-off-the-page writing, Nancy Goldstone brings to life these two remarkable women, as Europe goes through the convulsions that led up to the international landscape we recognize today."

As Hollywood prepares for its most glamorous evening, five actresses compete to see who will claim the top prize. Adria, a dignified and highly regarded grand dame of the movie industry, is intent on cementing her legacy as one of the greatest thespians of all time, even as the younger generation creeps up quickly behind her. Bitty must keep a nervous breakdown --- and an increasingly debilitating alcohol addiction --- at bay, as she searches for genuine closeness in an unforgiving landscape. Contessa, a former child star, is determined to make the world, and her leading man, take her seriously. Davina attempts to find her footing in superficial Los Angeles, a far cry from her roots as a serious London stage actress. And Jenny --- always the underdog to her rival, Adria --- sees this awards season as her personal redemption, a chance to atone for past mistakes and make up for missed opportunities. With humor, wit and an insider\u2019s insight, THE TALENT peels back the layers of women who are in the business of being perceived. And while they work to push their careers forward and maintain the public\u2019s goodwill, all five are forced to confront truths about themselves that they would rather ignore: Could Adria and Jenny have been a team all these years, rather than bitter enemies? Is it their responsibility to offer a lifeline to poor Bitty, who is clearly teetering on the edge? Should Contessa and Davina dim their own rising stars to make those around them more comfortable? What do women in the spotlight owe each other, and themselves?"

What do they know of her brother, Demetri, whose face echoes across every canvas? After all, Ava and Demetri have only ever had each other. Abandoned first by their mother, who drowned in the Long Island Sound, and then again by their father, who couldn\u2019t see beyond his grief, each sibling has always been the other\u2019s most ardent supporter: Demetri encouraged Ava\u2019s raw talent as a painter, while Ava pushed Demetri to pursue filmmaking. But as they make their way in New York, the codependency that once sustained them soon threatens to be their undoing. Betrayals mount, fueled by Ava\u2019s reckless acts and her disdain for Demetri\u2019s last-ditch efforts to make something of consequence, but what ultimately and irreversibly tips the scales won\u2019t be found on canvas or film. Because now, at 31, Demetri is dying.

Vaulting between childhood and the days leading up to Demetri\u2019s death, here is a searing portrait of two remarkable siblings reckoning with the limits of loyalty.

According to the Wilde family, if you look in the dictionary under \u201cblack sheep,\u201d you\u2019ll no doubt see a photo of Ricki Wilde. Ricki is the youngest of the privileged, esteemed Wilde girls, who are heiresses to their father\u2019s lucrative funeral home business. Her proud socialite sisters were happy to work their way up to owning their own franchises, thereby assuming control of their trust funds, but Ricki wants to make something of her own on her own. While her family has hosted galas, sipped on vodka and scheduled Botox appointments, Ricki has been quietly building her own empire. It\u2019s not a brick-and-mortar business like her father\u2019s, but an Instagram account, \u201cBotany Flowers Lately.\u201d Here, she shares her creative floral arrangements and boasts an impressive 300,000+ followers and brand partnerships lucrative enough to have secretly put herself through night school to earn a horticultural degree. In the Wilde family, though, the man --- that would be Richard Wilde, Sr. --- is the boss. And as the boss, he swiftly fires Ricki, telling her that if she wants to do it herself, she can go for it. \"Williams\u2019 writing is...a fresh and modern take on love and creation that is grounded in immense, sweeping history. The blending of these idiosyncratic tones reads like her love song to readers.\" A chance meeting lands Ricki in the basement apartment of a brownstone in Harlem, worlds away from her home (and family name) in Atlanta. She immediately sets to work cleaning up the front basement apartment, where she plans to launch Wilde Designs, and the smaller back studio, where she will live. After selling her car and three engagement rings (she has a type: quick to fall in love, quicker to fall out), Ricki has just enough savings to launch her business and give it her all. For exactly six months. If she fails, it\u2019s back to Atlanta, back to Wilde Funeral Homes, and back to what she not so affectionately refers to as the \u201cbrunchification of death\u201d --- aka her family\u2019s capitalist spin on the inevitable fates of their customers. Luckily for Ricki, chance is on her side. Her first few months in New York are marked by three incredible events: a steamy hookup with a smooth-brained, conspiracy-loving artist; an accidental meeting with Tuesday Rowe, a former child star and her current best friend; and, in her opening month, she not only meets her goals but doubles her projection. Then in January, she loses every cent when people stop coming to buy her gorgeous but expensive creations. However, chance isn\u2019t quite done with Ricki. On a midnight walk to blow off steam, she bumps into a man she comes to call Garden Gentleman. His features are cut from granite, his jawline is impossible, his brow is commanding and stern, and he\u2019s a musician, a creative like her. He tells Ricki one thing: that whatever is brewing between them can never, ever happen. But when repeated run-ins turn into daily drop-ins, it becomes obvious that there is something magical, fated between them, that has been building since before Ricki ever stepped foot in Harlem. Alternating timelines, Tia Williams takes readers to 1920s Harlem, where another young Black artist has just arrived in the city of magic. Ezra \u201cBreeze\u201d Walker III or IV (he can never be sure) has lost everything to Ku Klux Klan violence in his Georgia hometown, and he is finally ready to shed his dead-end sharecropper identity and give music, the thing that keeps him alive, a real try. Within five years, he is at the top of the jazz music scene in Harlem, where Black people are celebrated and his contemporaries aren\u2019t the church organ player but the likes of Duke Ellington, Fred Astaire and Ma Rainey. Unfortunately, with the highs come the lows. As fame takes over, Ezra (unknowingly) begins to race toward a cursed end. I won\u2019t reveal the mystery of how Ricki and Ezra\u2019s stories converge. But if the suspense isn\u2019t enough to draw you in, Williams\u2019 meticulous handling of history, sex, romance and fate will do the trick. To read Tia Williams is to read pure joy, unabashed and proud. Even when she is detailing the racist history of our country (especially sobering is the celebration of jazz-era Harlem compared to the current gentrification of those same buildings where history was made), her willingness and courage to find beauty in transformation is awe-inspiring. In her characters, particularly gorgeous, anxious and brilliant Ricki, Williams unlocks new levels of awareness and strength. Against all odds, they find ways to cultivate beauty in the world, turning their grievances and anxieties into pure creation. Much like a jazz song erupts from the fingers of its player, A LOVE SONG FOR RICKI WILDE soars. In an early scene, Ricki tries on the identity of a fl\u00e2neuse, a French concept built on idling and observing. She remarks that \u201cHarlem was a modern neighborhood superimposed over an old one. But in the negative spaces\u2026Ricki could make out the contours of a ghost city.\u201d Williams\u2019 writing is exactly like this: a fresh and modern take on love and creation that is grounded in immense, sweeping history. The blending of these idiosyncratic tones reads like her love song to readers. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on February 9, 2024"

        "review": " There is nothing like a tale of old Hollywood for glamour, drama, dreams and\u2026bloodshed. In the 1950s, stars and star makers, and gangsters and mafiosos, found their lives intertwined. From finances to romances, the famous and the infamous met, mingled and married in California and Las Vegas. The results were stormy at best and murderous at worst. In\u00a0A MURDER IN HOLLYWOOD, prolific true-crime author Casey Sherman presents the intersections of the film industry and crime syndicates through a look at the Turner-Stompanato murder case. \"Sherman offers a page-turner of an examination into one of the country\u2019s most notorious crimes. The narrative style is brisk and readable.\" In 1958, Johnny Stompanato, a mid-level gangster and gigolo and friend of the much more powerful Mickey Cohen, was stabbed to death in the home of award-winning and beloved actress Lana Turner. Turner\u2019s 14-year-old daughter, Cheryl, claimed responsibility, saying that she stabbed Stompanato in defense of her mother. Stompanato was Turner\u2019s on-again/off-again boyfriend, the latest in a string of often disastrous and even abusive relationships Turner had since her discovery at age 15. The investigation into and fallout from his death revealed not just Turner\u2019s own troubled history but also the cultivated yet dangerous connections between the entertainment industry and the mob. How did the former \u201csweater girl\u201d and the crook get together in the first place? It began as a plan to blackmail or extort Turner and ended in violence with plenty of misery along the way. Sherman writes about Turner\u2019s rags-to-riches success and her many heartaches, and he introduces Cohen, Stompanato and the other criminals who preyed upon so many of the Hollywood elite. The story is incredible --- thrilling, suspenseful, often pitiful. Turner and others like her were caught in a system of exploitation that made them vulnerable to many forms of manipulation and harm. And young Cheryl was a witness to much of it and was even less powerful. What really happened on that April night? Sherman offers a page-turner of an examination into one of the country\u2019s most notorious crimes. The narrative style is brisk and readable. There is not much analysis here, but the storytelling is sharp and compelling. The book\u00a0sheds light on cultural history and relations that tainted the glitz and aspirations, and the talents and successes, of some of the movie industry\u2019s biggest stars and most important artists. There are dark and astonishing moments here across decades of entertainment. At the center is Lana Turner and the two women closest to her: her mother and her daughter. Sherman always portrays her affecting humanity with respect and honesty. Rife with sexism, crime, secrets, power, love of all kinds and plenty of authorial conjecture,\u00a0A MURDER IN HOLLYWOOD offers an ambiguous theory of responsibility and leaves readers with plenty of questions and perhaps an interest in reading more about the seedy underbelly of mid-century Hollywood.

        "review": " Elegant, slippery and provocative, ANTIQUITY is a queer LOLITA story by prize-winning Swedish author Hanna Johansson --- a story of desire, power, obsession, observation and taboo On a Greek island rich with ancient beauty, a lonely woman in her 30s upends the relationship between a mother and her teenage daughter. Lust and admiration for Helena, a chic older artist, brings the book\u2019s unnamed narrator to Ermoupoli, where Helena\u2019s daughter, Olga, seems at first like an obstacle and a nuisance. But the unpredictable forces of ego and desire take over, leading our narrator down a more dangerous path, and causing the roles of lover and beloved, child and adult, stranger and intimate to become distorted. As the months go by, the fragile web connecting the three women nears rupture, and the ominous consequences of their entanglement loom just beyond a summer that must end. With echoes of DEATH IN VENICE, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME and THE LOVER, but wholly original and contemporary, ANTIQUITY probes the depths of memory, beauty, morality and the narratives that arrange our experience of the world."

        "review": " BECOMING ELLA FITZGERALD is Judith Tick\u2019s unique and valuable biography of one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest singers. Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s musical style has been and will continue to be cherished by those who share her wide range of genres, songs and syllables. Drawing on well-established sources, Tick\u2019s portrait begins as Ella began --- in a family officially designated at one time as \u201cmulatto,\u201d or mixed race. Her father left home when she was two, never to be seen again. Her mother, a hard-working woman, found another mate who moved the family from Virginia to Yonkers, New York. Though their neighborhood was not the best, it was a Black haven, and Ella excelled in her early education. But by her teen years, she was on the streets, spent time in a reformatory school, and by chance was \u201cdiscovered\u201d as she sang wherever she went. This led to her entry into a music competition, hoping to win recognition as a dancer. She ended up taking first prize --- as a singer. \"Tick brings Ella and her musical success to new light with diligent research, suggesting that she had many fears and sorrows. However, her determination and ability to rise and stay ahead was undeniable.\" What followed was a lifelong career that budded and bloomed with the help of admirers and those who thought to make a name or a fortune for themselves by touting and displaying her. Ella was reserved and rigorously polite in private, but she was different in public. She was adored by audiences and backed by a jazz band like that of Chick Webb, who first took her on (initially reluctantly) as a \u201cgirl singer.\u201d Her career ascent was steady and, by a certain point, dazzling, with television appearances on prime time and nearly constant touring. Her hits included \u201cCheek to Cheek\u201d and \u201cIt Don\u2019t Mean a Thing.\u201d Those who saw Ella perform knew that she had controlled but sensuous movements to match the swing of the music, and that her voice was almost like a newly invented and never-duplicated horn or pipe. She performed with the greats of her era, including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. She received a multitude of awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Some would say that she invented her chosen style of swing and made others want to imitate it. Her rhythmic \u201cscat\u201d singing was said to be the best in the world. Tick brings Ella and her musical success to new light with diligent research, suggesting that she had many fears and sorrows. However, her determination and ability to rise and stay ahead was undeniable. Tick offers a list of Ella\u2019s \u201cCharted Hot Singles,\u201d along with a lengthy bibliography. She portrays Ella in and out of the limelight with a kind of consistency that is a hallmark of those who gain enduring attention. No matter the size of her audience, Ella would review her set list before going onstage, making sure that it was appropriate and that she was fully prepared for the impression she wished to make. This is in line with what she said in her waning years: Sound and lyrics were her way of sharing, like \u201cneighbors, where we share and love each other.\u201d Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott on December 16, 2023"

        "review": " I never heard Maria Callas sing in person, but I fell in love with her voice --- uniquely dark and thrilling; wonderfully imperfect --- in my early 20s. I bought all her opera albums and saw her in a televised performance of Act II of Puccini\u2019s Tosca: a passionate, glamorous, murderous presence in red velvet and gold, all flashing eyes and high cheekbones. Don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t an opera buff. This novel about the famed Greek-American soprano isn\u2019t big on the musical aspect of her eventful career. Just as British author Daisy Goodwin\u2019s VICTORIA: A Novel of a Young Queen (2016; also a miniseries) sought to locate the woman within the monarch, DIVA emphasizes how Callas\u2019 artistry may have been sabotaged by her desperate need for love. Goodwin sets up her book as a three-act drama centered around Callas\u2019 very public nine-year affair with Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, which began in 1959. But within this structure there are plenty of flashbacks --- perhaps too many --- to her earlier life. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to suggest that driven, creative people are overcompensating for an unhappy childhood, but in Callas\u2019 case it seems to be true. Born in New York\u2019s Washington Heights (who knew?!) to immigrant parents whose marriage was already in trouble, and taken to Greece by her mother at age 13 (her father stayed in New York), she grew up in wartime, a hefty, glasses-wearing girl who lost the competition for maternal love with her older sister. Early on, Callas felt exploited by both her mother and her much older husband/manager, Giovanni Battista Meneghini, known as Tita. \"Callas\u2019 personality and talent make a rich subject, and anyone who loves her music and is intrigued by her colorful 'private' life will be drawn in by this book.\" Her voice was instantly acclaimed. And then, like a chrysalis, Callas emerged into full stardom: she lost weight, learned how to dress, and hobnobbed with the rich and famous. After crossing paths with the gossip columnist/society maven Elsa Maxwell, she was introduced to Onassis. Goodwin suggests that their bond was based not only on a shared Greek identity but on memories of growing up in hard times. \u201cWe have both had to struggle,\u201d Onassis told Callas. Unlike those born wealthy --- his wife, for example --- they were proudly self-made. At this point, DIVA becomes a \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d-esque miniseries in book form. The action moves between Onassis\u2019 yacht, the Christina; various luxury hotels and resorts; opera houses and upscale restaurants. Callas\u2019 wardrobe is described in enormous detail. Indeed, a simple computer search yields innumerable paparazzi shots of her, far taller than her husband or Onassis and almost always looking incredibly chic. According to Goodwin, this sense of style did not come naturally; she had a French design team who envisioned her as a goddess (\u201cNo frills, no bows, and absolutely no pink\u201d) and told her precisely which accessories to wear with which outfit. Ultimately, as we all know, Onassis betrayed Callas when he married Jackie Kennedy in 1968, a moment of public humiliation that begins and ends DIVA. But there were so many prior moments of infidelity, insensitivity and plain old lying on his part that it\u2019s difficult to believe that this came as a shock. At one point, Callas even attempted suicide while listening to her own recording of poor, abandoned Cio-Cio-San\u2019s aria \u201cUn bel di\u201d from Madame Butterfly (her performance is a masterpiece of power spliced with fragility). To my mind, though, what makes Callas a genuinely tragic figure was not her complicated love life but her anxiety about her voice, which, experts seem to agree, began to decline quite early in her career. The novel implies that her frequent cancellations and other prima-donna-ish behavior stemmed not from arrogance but from insecurity. Although the lure of her peripatetic life with Onassis may have been a distraction from work, more likely the problems had to do with the way she used, and abused, her voice in early performances. By the time she became more selective about what and when she sang, it may have been too late. In her Author\u2019s Note right at the beginning, Goodwin makes it clear that DIVA is a novel, not a biography, and that she has \u201ctaken a few liberties\u201d with dates in order to tell a compelling story. I don\u2019t mind that. Callas\u2019 personality and talent make a rich subject, and anyone who loves her music and is intrigued by her colorful \u201cprivate\u201d life will be drawn in by this book. I was especially interested in the idea that her passionate relationship with Onassis gave her new insights into powerful operatic characters like Norma and Tosca. However, I was bothered by the way the novel reads. It is chopped into multiple segments labeled for time and place, and further broken up by flashbacks and dialogue-heavy scenes. The effect is stilted and somewhat stagey, especially given cameo appearances by celebrities from Winston Churchill to Marilyn Monroe. There isn\u2019t a continuous narrative voice; it\u2019s more like a slideshow, with captions. Of course, Callas\u2019 life was nothing if not cinematic; in fact, a movie about her final days, Maria, is said to be opening this year. It stars Angelina Jolie and is directed by Pablo Larrra\u00edn, whose other films include the Oscar-nominated Jackie (the irony\u2026) and Spencer, about Princess Diana. He seems to have made a specialty of these lost, beautiful, press-hounded women. The tension between public and private self is common to all three, but Maria Callas was different from Jackie Kennedy or Diana Spencer. She is legendary because of her art, not her association with a famous man. This is made explicit in DIVA. At a party in Monte Carlo given by Prince Rainier and his wife, the former actress Grace Kelly, Callas observed Onassis flirting with Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy\u2019s sister and wife of a Polish prince. In a side conversation imagined by Goodwin, Princess Grace reminded Callas that \u201cyou and I\u2026are women in our own right. I have an Oscar and you are a great singer. But what is that so-called princess? Just a woman with a famous sister who dresses well and who laughs at men\u2019s jokes.\u201d Forbidden by Rainier to return to acting, Grace warned Callas not to stop singing. \u201cAristo [Onassis] isn\u2019t worth it; no man is.\u201d It\u2019s too bad that Callas didn\u2019t follow her advice. DIVA doesn\u2019t reach very far into the singer\u2019s post-Onassis life, but the novel certainly foreshadows the dwindling of her career and her premature death, of a heart attack, at age 53. What a loss. What a story. Reviewed by Katherine B. Weissman on January 26, 2024"

But even before Daphne began going on dates with boys, she started getting little notes --- on the backs of envelopes, on receipt paper, in fortune cookies, or on parking tickets --- that listed the name of a boy (or later a man) and a length of time. That duration, Daphne soon realized, indicated the length of time she'd spend involved with a romantic partner before they'd split up or grow apart, before he'd move or reunite with an ex. The duration might be months, or years, or maybe just a single night (ahem). But every time, without fail, the slip of paper arrives. Every time, Daphne knows exactly what she's in for and for how long. \"[EXPIRATION DATES] manages to be both remarkably romantic and quite unexpected, casting a charming spell on readers ready to believe in a little magic --- or just the miracle of the everyday.\" That is, until she meets Jake. Set up by a mutual friend, Daphne hits it off with Jake right away. And she's trying not to freak out about the fact that when she receives a paper with Jake's name on it, that's all there is. No duration, no indication that this love affair is ever going to end. Could this be it? Is Jake \"The One\"? Daphne is sure that he is, and for the first time in her life, she allows herself to believe in a happily ever after. But even as her relationship with Jake progresses, even as he shows her in a thousand different ways that he's her perfect match, Daphne knows there's something she should be telling Jake, a secret that might affect the duration of their relationship whether or not she plans for it. Daphne's ex-boyfriend (and still best friend), Hugo, is the only person who knows all of her secrets, but in this case he's probably the worst place for her to go for advice. She has to figure out on her own whether to trust the magic or to take a leap into the unknown. EXPIRATION DATES has a somewhat whimsical premise, but the underlying themes are serious. When do we know when to stop searching for love? How do we trust ourselves to know when we've found lasting love? Would believing in destiny blind us to another person's faults or just make us more accepting of them? And can you really fall in love if you're keeping secrets? Among other things, Rebecca Serle's novel is a love letter to Los Angeles --- not just to the entertainment industry in which Jake and Daphne work but also to the unsung, hidden places that most tourists might overlook or just be unaware of. It also manages to be both remarkably romantic and quite unexpected, casting a charming spell on readers ready to believe in a little magic --- or just the miracle of the everyday.

        "review": " I guarantee that FOURTEEN DAYS is unlike anything you have ever read. A \u201ccollaborative novel\u201d set in New York City in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdowns, its powerful stories are told by a number of different characters. The book\u2019s concept is a brilliant one. Led by general editors Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston, and on behalf of the Authors Guild, this is not a serial novel nor does it follow the rules of classic frame narratives as seen in such works as THE DECAMERON or THE CANTERBURY TALES. Rather, the 14 days depicted here contain a series of novellas strung together by its various authors to portray different stories being shared by the residents of an apartment building on the Lower East Side who meet on their rooftop every evening at 7:00 to cheer medical personnel. Here is a novel about the very essence of storytelling that celebrates the written word in an incredibly unique way. \"This is the best fictional work I have ever read regarding the pandemic; it is extremely touching and memorable. I only hope that it is never made into a film. FOURTEEN DAYS belongs exclusively to the readers.\" If there is a narrator here, it would be the building\u2019s Romanian super, who keeps a record of all the stories told over the two-week period. She learned how to do her job by watching her father (who also was a super) at a building in Queens when she was a child. She now laments how the pandemic has kept her from her father, who she would like to check on but has been unable to reach. The previous super kept a book referred to as \"The Fernsby Bible,\" which was named for the building and contained information on each tenant, along with the nicknames he gave them. Thanks to this resource, the current super quickly identifies the first six people who gather on the rooftop: Vinegar, Eurovision, the Lady with the Rings, the Therapist, Florida, and Hello Kitty. They get somewhat acquainted with each other and begin sharing stories. It isn\u2019t long before the group grows considerably as more tenants learn about this nightly ritual. Eurovision supplies the music, and they entertain each other with various tales. There\u2019s no need to look for a message, as some are just simply good stories. But they all work wonders in connecting people who otherwise are disconnected and are only brought together due to this global health crisis. Many of these stories are incredibly moving or ironic based on what is going on in their world. Several involve the dead or dying. For instance, Whitney, the museum librarian, provides a chilling tale about encountering a ghost while visiting the Alamo. Not everyone appreciates every story that is told. Some are true, while others are pure fiction. Eurovision kindly reminds them of the purpose of their sessions by quoting the great Oscar Wilde: \"Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.\" It will be purely up to the reader to try to determine which author contributed which piece of the story, as no names are attached to the 14 days. In all, 36 top-flight writers lend their talents to this unique exercise, and the results are truly something special. This is the best fictional work I have ever read regarding the pandemic; it is extremely touching and memorable. I only hope that it is never made into a film. FOURTEEN DAYS belongs exclusively to the readers. Reviewed by Ray Palen on February 9, 2024"

        "review": " You probably remember the Greek myth of Persephone. Having been abducted by Hades and made queen of the underworld, Persephone makes the mistake of eating pomegranate seeds and consequently is compelled to return to the underworld for several months each year. During that time, Persephone's mother, Demeter, goddess of the harvest, is in mourning. The earth mourns along with her, causing winter to return. On one level, this story is a nature myth, explaining the changing of the seasons in an imaginative and evocative way. It's also about the power imbalances between men and women, particularly when one of those men is the almighty god of the underworld and the other is a young woman whose relative power resides only in her physical allure. That's the element of the story that Rachel Lyon uses as the jumping-off point for FRUIT OF THE DEAD, her contemporary reimagining of the Persephone and Demeter myth. \"It's perhaps too easy to call FRUIT OF THE DEAD hypnotic, given the effects of the drug that ensnares Cory. But it does pull readers out of time and immerse them in a story that feels both ages old and entirely new.\" In Lyon's novel, the Persephone character is named Cory (a nod to Persephone's other name in Greek mythology, \"Kore,\" or \"the maiden\"). When readers first meet her, she's wrapping up a summer of camp counseling without a clear idea of what to do next. She hasn't gotten into college, and going to work for her mother Emer's agricultural NGO is not exactly appealing. Cory does have a special bond with one of the campers, a quiet little boy named Spenser. When, on the last day of camp, Spenser's dad, Rolo Picazo, sees how well Cory cares for his son and how easily she attracts the admiration of Spenser's younger sister Fern, he offers Cory an alternative. Recently divorced, Picazo has custody of both children for the next few months while their mother cares for the newborn she's had with her new husband. Picazo is a wealthy businessman whose professional life is about to get even more complicated. He could really use some help with childcare so that he can deal with the various legal challenges facing his pharmaceutical company. When he offers Cory the opportunity to spend this time on his private island off the coast of Maine, she barely hesitates before accepting. Cory finds Picazo oddly alluring, if not conventionally handsome. It also doesn't hurt that he's so wealthy and seems to genuinely find her fascinating. When she arrives at the island, she discovers some vaguely ominous signs, hints that she might have gotten in over her head. But when Picazo introduces her to his company's signature drug, Granadone, she ceases to care, losing track of her priorities, her purpose and even her sense of time itself. Third-person accounts of Cory's strange new life with Picazo alternate with first-person chapters from the perspective of Emer. In the face of shaky product test results and mounting concern for Cory, she takes off to find her daughter, at immense professional risk to herself. In part, Emer's impulsive actions are prompted by the present situation, but they're also an opportunity of sorts to reconcile a past betrayal, a time when she deeply disappointed Cory and damaged their relationship as a result. Those who are familiar with the original myth will find plenty of little Easter eggs to appreciate here. Picazo's three dogs, for example, are cloned versions of a single dog, making a sort of genetically engineered Cerberus. But this is far more than a clever retelling; it's also a thoroughly contemporary novel about the lure of narcotics, a powerful mother-daughter story about the lengths a mother will travel in order to save her most precious relationship, and a devastating indictment of power and risk imbalances between older, wealthy men and much younger women. It's perhaps too easy to call FRUIT OF THE DEAD hypnotic, given the effects of the drug that ensnares Cory. But it does pull readers out of time and immerse them in a story that feels both ages old and entirely new. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on March 29, 2024"

Like the Bagthorpes, Reilly's Vladisavljevic family is eccentric, intelligent and prone to emotional fragility, and readers' first impression might be one of a glorious, confusing, muddled mess. Part of this stems from Reilly's approach to exposition. It takes readers many chapters to figure out basic facts such as characters' occupations, relationships and names (though the list of dramatis personae at the book\u2019s opening helps (as it does in many Russian novels, from which Reilly also seems to draw some inspiration). There are a lot of characters, many of whom share the same name. All of this becomes clear, but for the first 50 pages or so, readers may have the distinct feeling of being dropped into a wedding or family reunion, without a clear sense of family dynamics, backstories or inside jokes. \"Reilly's writing is charmingly deadpan, and her characters are true originals. Greta and Valdin's relationship is perhaps the most touching.\" However, things do gradually become clear, and readers eagerly will go along for the ride as soon as they're introduced to the distinctive voices of the title characters, who narrate most of the story in alternating chapters. Greta and Valdin are siblings in their 20s. Older brother Valdin is nursing a broken heart after the end of a relationship with Xabier (known as Xabi), who also happens to be their uncle's husband's brother. Valdin recently has embarked on a somewhat unexpected career trajectory. After years studying physics (and finally realizing that academic research made him miserable), he's now the host of a travel show on television. Younger sister Greta, who's earning her master's degree in comparative literature, also has been unlucky in love, though that may be about to change when she meets Ell, a graduate student in biology. It's a little awkward that Ell is in Greta's dad's department at the university, but that's hardly the biggest relationship complication that arises. Among other things, Greta is concerned that their mother (a M\u0101ori youth theater producer) may be harboring feelings for an old flame. Their father (also named Valdin but always called Linsh), who emigrated from Moldova to New Zealand when he was a child, is altogether too trusting, if not entirely clueless. A specialist in marine fungus, his mind is often a million miles away from the concerns that plague the rest of his family. If this all sounds complicated, it is, in the best possible way. The Vladisavljevic family members are smart, vulnerable and often very funny. Reilly's writing is charmingly deadpan, and her characters are true originals. Greta and Valdin's relationship is perhaps the most touching. Even as they start to look to romantic partners to form new kinds of families, they desperately need to keep one another as friends, touchstones and confidantes. One gets the sense that countless other stories could come out of this family. If Reilly hosts a family reunion, readers will be eager to crash the party.

        "review": " Happy relationships are possible --- for everyone. Even if you\u2019ve been married for 20 years and your routine is boring and stressful; although your mom has always been a help-resistant complainer; and despite the fact that your dearest friend moved across the country --- all of us can create lasting and joyful connections with the people we care about the most. Using simple tools drawn from the Buddhist tradition, you can cultivate appreciation, set wise expectations, and create meaningful and intimate bonds of mutual support and kindness with your partner, family and friends. That\u2019s because our happiness isn\u2019t dependent on everything in our lives being perfect. In fact, we can experience conflict, disagreement, job loss, grief and boredom and still have appreciation, delight and gratitude for everyone in our life. We can create happiness by improving the quality of our attention, the depth of our compassion, and our willingness to repair ruptures and let go of resentments. HAPPY RELATIONSHIPS is designed for all of us who are sometimes challenged by our husbands, wives, kids, parents and best friends. It\u2019s for anyone in happy marriages and close-knit families who want to feel closer and more connected to the most important people in their lives. HAPPY RELATIONSHIPS is a relatable and useful guide with practical applications to help us stay attuned and cultivate understanding with our dearest people: an inconsiderate partner repeatedly ignoring our requests; repairing the rupture from a conflict with a sibling; celebrating a child\u2019s success; or learning to communicate with a difficult parent. Each short chapter honestly describes, in three to four pages, a common shared experience --- such as the stress of old resentments, the opportunity of celebrating together mindfully, the nightly routine of a child\u2019s bedtime, spending time with old friends. It is followed by a brief practice --- a meditation, exercise or contemplation that readers can use to orient their beautiful qualities of love, kindness and wisdom to communicate and act in ways that lead to joy. HAPPY RELATIONSHIPS readers can use these practices alone or with their loved one anytime --- during the most mundane daily routine, to the excitement of a big gathering, through the sadness of loss."

        "review": " According to a recent article in the New York Times, five years after the publication of her critically praised and popular 2013 novel, THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF NATHANIEL P., Adelle Waldman took a job unloading trucks at a Target near her home in Rhinebeck, New York, hoping to find inspiration for her next work of fiction. Readers of HELP WANTED, her reflective, wry second novel, will be happy she made this choice and succeeded handsomely in her search. If \u201cThe Office\u201d had been centered on the warehouse crew at Dunder Mifflin, but without playing its workers entirely for laughs, it might have looked something like Waldman\u2019s book. Set sometime during the Trump presidency in the fictional upstate New York town of Potterstown, a place that\u2019s \u201cas much museum as city\u201d since the departure of an IBM facility and the Great Recession, it focuses on the 13 members of \u201cTeam Movement\u201d at Store #1512 of the big-box chain known as Town Square. \"There are plenty of pundits commenting on the challenges facing working-class Americans today, but sometimes fiction\u2019s tools are more useful in exposing the truth. That\u2019s the beauty of what Adelle Waldman has accomplished here.\" The job of these part-time employees involves working a shift between 4am and 8am, unloading a truckload of merchandise in less than one hour and stocking the shelves with these items. Because their positions don\u2019t produce sufficient income to provide for them and their families, most have second jobs, relying on food stamps to help feed themselves and often foregoing health insurance. Like all physical retailers, their employer is locked in what feels like a desperate losing battle against an entity that Waldman refers to only as the \u201conline retailer,\u201d as if it \u201cpossessed occult powers by which the utterance of its name would strengthen it.\u201d The conflict at the center of HELP WANTED is launched by the impending promotion of Big Will, the store\u2019s manager. One of the two candidates to replace him is Meredith, the decidedly unpopular leader of Team Movement. Despite her loathing for her boss, a veteran team member named Val hatches a scheme to boost Meredith\u2019s chances. If she moves up, it will set in motion a chain of likely internal promotions that may include the plan\u2019s ringleader herself. With gentle humor, Waldman follows the execution of Val\u2019s at times ham-handed plan alongside Meredith\u2019s awkward last-minute effort to ingratiate herself with her underlings as the date for a decision approaches. One of her principal talents lies in efficiently creating appealing characters who are much more than predictable workplace archetypes, even as their diversity \u201cwould have made the headmaster of a private school bug-eyed with envy.\u201d In addition to sharing their varied histories, she does this by providing small but meaningful insights into their behavior that distinguish one from the other. Among them are the pride that one employee takes in her neat one-bedroom apartment and her reluctance to invite her co-workers to visit for fear that they\u2019ll disturb its order; the pleasure of another employee in initiating the unloading process in a way that tells a sort of story in the order he takes the boxes out of the truck, in one case \u201cdramatizing the human life cycle\u201d; and the distant dream of a third worker of earning a college football scholarship, even as he has accumulated a record of minor crimes and lacks the GED he\u2019ll need to advance at the store. Realistic or not, every one of Team Movement\u2019s workers, who might slip easily into a Richard Russo novel, harbors a vision of a better life. Some have struggled with drugs or alcohol, others have been unable to find happiness in stable romantic relationships. As Waldman portrays it, each faces obstacles --- whether personal or societal --- that for most of them make those goals seem unattainable, and she subtly evokes our ability to identify with them as human beings in the process. Waldman maintains the suspense surrounding whether or not Meredith will secure her promotion until near the end of the novel. But the outcome of that contest, and the success or failure of Val\u2019s scheme, is almost beside the point. In truth, the book is much more about illuminating the lives of the people who unload the trucks and stock the shelves at Target or Costco --- and, by extension, those of the millions of invisible others whose toil is essential to the functioning of the American economy. The Irish novelist Colum McCann once wrote, \u201cI happen to think that an ounce of empathy is worth a boatload of judgment.\u201d It\u2019s impossible to come away from this novel without at least a bit more empathy for its characters and their real-life counterparts. There are plenty of pundits commenting on the challenges facing working-class Americans today, but sometimes fiction\u2019s tools are more useful in exposing the truth. That\u2019s the beauty of what Adelle Waldman has accomplished here. Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg on March 15, 2024"

        "review": " Scott Carson is the pen name for legendary thriller writer Michael Koryta. I respect that Koryta\u2019s love of horror is strong enough for him to write under a different name so that he receives the accolades he deserves for stepping out of his typical comfort zone. His latest effort, LOST MAN\u2019S LANE, not only lives up to the hype but may be his best book to date. The novel reads like a superior work of literary fiction as it tells a coming-of-age tale set in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1999. However, just underneath the surface of this small town is plenty of horrific elements --- some human, some unexplainable and clearly of the supernatural variety. This is what torments our narrator, high school student Marshall Miller. He sees things that other people don\u2019t, which makes him both a valuable witness in a criminal case and a pariah later on. \"As I was reading this instant classic, I kept thinking about the iconic novels that it reminded me of, like Stephen King\u2019s IT, Dan Simmons\u2019 SUMMER OF NIGHT, and Robert McCammon\u2019s BOY\u2019S LIFE. This is literary horror written by a master storyteller at the top of his game.\" Marshall is an only child being raised by his mother, Monica, a popular meteorologist who is known for the tagline \u201cIt\u2019s Miller time.\u201d The big event for Marshall is finally getting his driver\u2019s license. Unfortunately, the first time he heads out on the road by himself as a licensed driver, he is stopped by the police. Corporal Maddox, who coyly pronounces his title \u201cCorporeal,\u201d berates Marshall for doing 39 in a 30 zone and uses language most would find inappropriate for a member of law enforcement. Marshall is shaken by the exchange and accepts his ticket. As Maddox pulls away, Marshall notices that there is a teenage girl in the back seat of the police cruiser wearing a dress that resembles the uniform at a local ice cream parlor. Readers should keep in mind that Marshall\u2019s keen sense of awareness and eagle eye will both help and hurt him. With no social media to speak of in 1999, AIM allowed for basic online communication. It is through this instant messaging service that Marshall, his buddy Dom, and his closest friend for whom he carries a torch, Kerri Flanders, find out about one of Sean Weller\u2019s legendary keg parties on Lost Man\u2019s Lane. At that first gathering, Marshall comes away with a potential girlfriend in Leslie Carter. When he shares the story of his run-in with Corporal Maddox, he finds out that there is no such position in the police department. He also learns that the girl he saw in Maddox\u2019s vehicle could be the missing Meredith Sullivan, who disappeared on the same day that he was pulled over. It turns out that Leslie\u2019s dad is a police officer, and she asks Marshall to share his encounter with him. This also brings the Meredith Sullivan case to the forefront of local media and provides hope for her parents, who have never stopped searching for her. Marshall reaches out to the private investigator, Noah Storm, who has been working with the Sullivan family to find Meredith. Marshall makes such an impression on Noah that he offers the 16-year-old a summer job as his one and only intern. Kerri gives Marshall some classic noir books to read in order to prepare for the internship, and he dives into his work feet first. One day, Marshall and Kerri go to Noah\u2019s home office, and Marshall is horrified to find his employer shot through the head and his throat slashed. He then sees his recent nemesis, Maddox, sitting on the staircase mocking him. He runs out of the house in a panic and contacts the police. None other than Detective Carter shows up, and after hearing Marshall\u2019s story, he is about to knock on the front door when Noah walks out unharmed and very much alive. Marshall is taken to the police station, where they grill him about his false claims and threaten him. He is no longer the town hero and quickly becomes the town liar. The Sullivans are devastated that his clue about their daughter was probably a lie. Marshall is sent to counseling, loses his job with Noah, and must deal with this unwanted infamy from everyone in town and, worst of all, his school. Marshall is positive about what he saw and now believes that not only is Maddox some sort of supernatural \u201ccorporeal\u201d figure but that Noah may not be who he claims to be. As I was reading this instant classic, I kept thinking about the iconic novels that it reminded me of, like Stephen King\u2019s IT, Dan Simmons\u2019 SUMMER OF NIGHT, and Robert McCammon\u2019s BOY\u2019S LIFE.

I firmly believe that these books are at their best when the plot deals with Aim\u00e9e on a personal level. No story to date is more personal than this 21st and latest entry, MURDER AT LA VILLLETTE. It is 2002, and Aim\u00e9e is on an undercover assignment at a company in Paris. While there, she finds a manager abusing one of the hired cleaning staff and promptly intervenes. Aim\u00e9e promises to stand up for Isabelle as a witness to protect her job and ensure that the actions against her are properly punished. She has no idea at this time how valuable an ally she has made in Isabelle. \"MURDER AT LA VILLETTE is indeed one of the finest entries in this series as Aim\u00e9e\u2019s entire litany of friends and family are involved in the most personal and confounding case of her career.\" Meanwhile, Aim\u00e9e continues to be harassed by calls from her ex-lover, J\u00e9rome Melac, all concerning a nasty custody battle involving their three-year-old daughter, Chlo\u00e9. She is reluctant to even listen to the messages, but for some reason she decides to play the most recent one. It is quite cryptic as Melac, a police detective, claims that he has \u201cjust seen a ghost.\u201d She calls him back, and he answers with a gurgle before the call cuts off. She fears he\u2019s in serious trouble and happens to spy along the canal by the drawbridge what looks like a figure floating in the water. It turns out to be none other than Melac, an obvious victim of an attack as his throat has been slashed. No sooner does Aim\u00e9e make this gruesome discovery than she is accosted from behind by someone with an authoritative tone who sounds like a policeman. He subdues her, sticks a bloody knife in her hand, and bashes her over the head so she would be found with the murder weapon that was used on Melac. Aim\u00e9e wakes up in the hospital and has difficulty seeing. Years earlier on a prior case, she sustained serious damage to her ocular nerve that nearly cost her her eyesight. Following examinations, she will be interrogated by the police as the prime suspect in Melac\u2019s murder. She contacts her godfather and mentor, Commissarie Morbier, to be there with her and use whatever influence he can to get her freed and back to Chlo\u00e9 as she knows she did not commit this crime. When the interrogation, as well as the lack of assistance from Morbier, does not seem to make for a rosy outcome, Aim\u00e9e finds the first opportunity to flee. Now on the run and wanted for Melac\u2019s slaying, she must attempt to work the case herself to clear her name so she can return to her precious daughter. The first guardian angel she runs into is the very same Isabelle she helped out earlier. It turns out that Isabelle works with a local biker gang and has a side gig pedaling wholesale cigarettes. They take Aim\u00e9e in and provide her cover. They also are the eyes and ears of the neighborhood and will assist with any evidence they can uncover about the case. Aim\u00e9e begins her private campaign to obtain freedom by speaking with those who might be able to help. A young research assistant makes her aware of the decades-old case involving the serial killer known as le Belafre, who raped and murdered both young women and grandmothers in ritualistic fashion from 1986-1994. Since he was never brought to justice, word has it that he might be back at work again. Could he have been the \u201cghost\u201d Melac saw the night of his murder? If so, might he be a current or former police officer, which could explain why Morbier backed off when Aim\u00e9e told her story about someone else being at the scene of the crime? As the situation gets more dire and deadlier, Aim\u00e9e realizes that she does not know who she can trust. Even her current boyfriend, who works with the police, refuses to assist her --- making her believe that the \u201cblue wall of silence\u201d is indeed working against her and that she truly is alone. She turns up both good and bad clues and/or red herrings and receives unexpected help along the way. Even with some sort of assistance, Aim\u00e9e is still in constant peril, and Cara Black continues to throw one roadblock after another her way straight through to the surprising conclusion. MURDER AT LA VILLETTE is indeed one of the finest entries in this series as Aim\u00e9e\u2019s entire litany of friends and family are involved in the most personal and confounding case of her career.

In the fall of 1871, Chicagoans knew they were due for the \u201cbig one\u201d --- a massive, uncontrollable fire that would decimate the city. It had been bone-dry for months, and a recent string of blazes had nearly outstripped the fire department\u2019s already scant resources. Then, on October 8th, a minor fire broke out in the barn of Irishwoman Kate Leary. A series of unfortunate mishaps and misunderstandings, along with insufficient preparation and a high southwesterly wind, combined to set the stage for an unmitigated catastrophe. The conflagration that spread from the Learys' property quickly overtook the neighborhood, and before long the floating embers had been cast to the far reaches of the city. Nothing to the northeast was safe. Families took to the streets with every possession they could carry. Powerful gusts whipped the flames into a terrifying firestorm. The Chicago River boiled. Over the next 48 hours, Chicago fell victim to the largest and most destructive natural disaster the United States had yet endured. The effects of the Great Fire were devastating. But they were also transforming. Out of the ashes, faster than seemed possible, rose new homes, tenements, hotels and civic buildings, as well as a new political order. The elite seized the reconstruction to crack down on vice, control the disbursement of vast charitable funds, and rebuild the city in their image. But the city\u2019s working class recognized only a naked power grab that would challenge their traditions, hurt their chances to keep their hard-earned property, and move power out of the hands of elected officials and into private interests. As soon as the battle against the fire ended, another battle for the future of the city erupted between its entrenched business establishment and its poor and immigrant laborers and shopkeepers. An enrapturing account of the fire\u2019s inexorable march and an eye-opening look at its aftermath, THE BURNING OF THE WORLD tells the story of one of the most infamous calamities in history and the new Chicago it precipitated --- a disaster that still shapes American cities to this day."

Since Jacqueline Winspear has announced that it will be the final installment, I know many readers will share my feelings of both appreciation and wistfulness as this brilliant series comes to a close. When we met Maisie Dobbs in 2003, she was a young woman in 1929, just getting her feet under her as a private investigator and learning from her mentor, while still coping with her experiences as a nurse during the Great War. Now, Maisie is a mature wife and mother with a successful career and a comfortable home life. But in 1945, she and so many others in England are still coping with the aftermath of two devastating world wars. \"[E]ven though readers might be disappointed that there are no new Maisie Dobbs mysteries to anticipate, they can gain comfort in the fact that this wise, compassionate and resilient protagonist will always be available for a return visit in the pages of Winspear's resplendent series.\" The ways in which wartime trauma is recapitulated has been an ongoing theme of the series, and that continues to be true here. A young man is at death's door, nearly starving and inarticulate. As we soon discover, he is a newly released prisoner of war, still reeling from torture in a Japanese prison. He also has a close relationship with one of Maisie's oldest and dearest friends. Maisie's discovery of him in a London home introduces her to four British teenagers, surprising foot soldiers in an underground civilian army, trained and ready to mobilize should the Nazis invade. By 1945, it's clear that this possibility has faded, but these young people remain profoundly scarred not only by the intensity of their training, but by a murder they claim to have witnessed. THE COMFORT OF GHOSTS is really two mysteries in one. At first, Maisie sets out to gather more information about the apparent Nazi sympathizer --- one with surprising ties to another of Maisie's acquaintances --- whose death the children have described. But in the book\u2019s final third, the mystery grows more personal, as newly discovered information sheds light on a long-buried family secret, one with relevance to Maisie's very first cases all those years ago. Winspear utilizes an image of a dragon to describe the ways in which the damage of war, even for the civilian population, continues to haunt the British people emerging from 30 years of war. She shows how the scars of war can be borne physically but also manifest themselves in surprising, sometimes uncontrollable ways: in the form of addictive behaviors, unexplained violence, suspicions, damaged relationships and broken hearts. At times, Maisie's journey in this final novel can feel like Old Home Week, as she reconnects with almost all of the (still living) characters who have played recurring roles in the series and provides more backstory on them. This level of exposition might be a bit unnecessary, especially for longtime fans. However, it\u2019s possible that this walk down memory lane will prompt some nostalgic readers to want to start from the beginning. The good news is that they'll be able to do so in style. Winspear's publisher is planning a 20th anniversary re-release of the first book later this year. So even though readers might be disappointed that there are no new Maisie Dobbs mysteries to anticipate, they can gain comfort in the fact that this wise, compassionate and resilient protagonist will always be available for a return visit in the pages of Winspear's resplendent series.

        "review": " From the New York Times bestselling author of MANHUNT (now an Apple TV+ series) and in the tradition of EMPIRE OF THE SUN MOON comes \u201ca vivid account\u201d (The Wall Street Journal) of a forgotten chapter in American history: the deadly confrontation between natives and colonists in Massachusetts in 1704 and the tragic saga that unfolded. Once it was one of the most infamous events in early American history. Today, it has been nearly forgotten. In an obscure, 200-year-old museum in a little town in western Massachusetts, there stands what once was the most revered relic from the history of early New England: the massive, tomahawk-scarred door that came to symbolize the notorious Deerfield Massacre of 1704. This impregnable barricade --- known to early Americans as \u201cThe Old Indian Door\u201d --- constructed from double-thick planks of Massachusetts oak and studded with hand-wrought iron nails to repel the tomahawk blades wielded by several attacking Native tribes, is the sole surviving artifact from one of the most dramatic moments in colonial American history: In the leap year of 1704, on the cold, snowy night of February 29th, hundreds of Indians and their French allies swept down on an isolated frontier outpost to slaughter or capture its inhabitants. The sacking of Deerfield led to one of the greatest sagas of survival, sacrifice, family and faith ever told in North America. One hundred and twelve survivors, including their fearless minister, the Reverend John Williams, were captured and forced to march 300 miles north into enemy territory in Canada. Any captive who faltered or became too weak to continue the journey --- including Williams\u2019s own wife --- fell under the tomahawk or war club. Survivors of the march willed themselves to live and endured captivity. Ransomed by the royal governor of Massachusetts, the captives later returned home to Deerfield, rebuilt their town and, for the rest of their lives, told the incredible tale. The memoir of Rev. Williams, THE REDEEMED CAPTIVE, published soon after his liberation, became one of the first bestselling books in American history and remains a literary classic. The Old Indian Door is a touchstone that conjures up one of the most dramatic and inspiring stories of colonial America --- and now, at last, this legendary event is brought to vivid life by popular historian James Swanson."

One is marked by the loss of the other from the outset. There is no getting over loss. Loss is the condition of existence.\u201d Neil fixates on visions of Phaedra, including her standing on a purple carpet of jacaranda blossoms in New Jersey. The reader is volleyed between Neil and Lucia\u2019s narration, then and now. Lucia is a complex character plagued by trauma, shame, guilt and ongoing self-doubt.

Each character has strength and vulnerable weakness churning like the Pollock analogy. This classic whodunit/whydunit with a stunning finale is also a tragic tale of loss and failed attempts at redemption. The reader becomes a student in the Philosophy department, or perhaps a guinea pig to be examined. THE DEPARTMENT is over-the-top brilliant and intellectually intriguing, with a concussion-grenade conclusion. It is sure to earn an Anthony Award nomination, likely the Big Kahuna: Best First Novel.

Three Rock & Roll icons. Two explosive tell-all memoirs. One ghostwriter caught in the middle. Anke Berben is ready to tell all. A legendary model and style icon, she reveled in headline-grabbing romances with not one but three members of the hugely influential rock band the Midnight Ramblers. The band members were as famous for their backstage drama as for their music, and Anke is the only one who fully understands the tangled relationships, betrayals and suspicions that have added to the Ramblers\u2019 enduring appeal and mystique. That is most evident in the mystery around Anke\u2019s role in the death of Mal, the band\u2019s founder and Anke\u2019s husband, in 1969. When Mari Hawthorn accepts the job to work with Anke on her memoir, she is dead set on getting to the truth of Mal\u2019s death. She has always been deft at navigating the fatal charms of celebrities, having grown up with a narcissistic, alcoholic father. As she ingratiates herself into the world of the band, she grows enchanted, against her better judgment, by these legendary rock stars. She knows she can\u2019t get pulled in too deep, otherwise she\u2019ll compromise her objectivity --- and her integrity.

I am proud to say that I have been there from the beginning as Karin Slaughter has been dishing out first-class thrillers in this series for quite some time. In Slaughter's most recent release, THIS IS WHY WE LIED, the quirky but extremely precise GBI investigator is in fine form and dealing with a unique case while on his honeymoon with his bride, Sara Linton, the medical examiner he has worked with for years. They have left Atlanta for an excursion to McAlpine Lodge deep in the woods in an off-the-grid setting that promises activities you would expect from life in the mountains. Slaughter provides a full map of the Lodge and the surrounding area, which comes in very handy. It ends up becoming the Clue board on which a murder mystery game is about to be played. \"Karin Slaughter\u2019s writing is like a house on fire and is so intricately plotted that I just could not turn the pages of this one quickly enough.\" Will and Sara\u2019s attempt at a late-night skinny-dipping session at the nearby lake is abruptly thwarted by a bone-chilling scream. After clumsily putting his clothes back on, Will discovers the body of Mercy McAlpine, the manager of the Lodge. She is covered in blood, the result of several stab wounds, but is still alive. Will proceeds with CPR as she whispers to him that she doesn\u2019t want her 16-year-old son to see her and urges him to let someone know that she forgives them. She then succumbs to her wounds, which becomes a homicide for Will and Sara to investigate. So much for their honeymoon. Sara makes Will aware that his hand has been skewered by the blade that had been sticking out of Mercy\u2019s stomach as he began chest compressions. She skillfully removes it without any nerve damage, and their focus shifts to the residents of the Lodge who are now suspects. They consist of three other couples staying at various cabins, as well as the entire McAlpine family, all of whom are employed there and live on the property. The staff and kitchen workers went home at 8:30pm, so they are in the clear. The story eventually shifts back to 10 hours before the murder, slowly working its way up in real time to the homicide and the ensuing investigation. There are so many broken and suspicious relationships to tease any mystery fan, and there is a dual meaning to the book\u2019s title. Initially, Will and Sara are there with fake bios so as not to reveal their law enforcement roles, and Sara utters those words to explain their reasoning for the deception. The same quote is also used by one of the residents at the Lodge, which rings true when Will and Sara begin to battle their way through lie after lie to try to find the guilty party. Will Trent is one of the most interesting crime fighters out there, and I love spending time with him. I can\u2019t get the image of actor Ramon Rodriguez out of my head as I am reading, even though he doesn\u2019t physically resemble the Will Trent of the novels. Karin Slaughter\u2019s writing is like a house on fire and is so intricately plotted that I just could not turn the pages of this one quickly enough. Reviewed by Ray Palen on August 23, 2024"

Within hours of the birth, the unthinkable happens: the newborn is abducted, leaving Charli devastated and wondering if she\u2019ll ever find her child, even after she gets free. Attorney Camille Delaney isn\u2019t used to the inside of women\u2019s prisons --- she works in courtrooms. But when a local legal aid group recruits her to help with a case on the inside, she feels drawn to these women\u2019s stories. They are often so similar --- a lifetime of trauma culminating in the heartbreaking and often permanent loss of custody of their children, even after they\u2019ve served their time and gotten clean. When Camille meets Charli, it\u2019s been years since Willow was abducted, and the case has gone cold. But there\u2019s something about Charli\u2019s story --- and Charli herself --- that Camille can\u2019t refuse. With the help of her trusted friend and private investigator, Trish Seaholm, Camille begins a dogged pursuit to find Charli\u2019s daughter and bring the man who framed Charli to justice. As Camille\u2019s quest for the truth takes her team from Seattle to the San Juan Islands to the mountains of Olympic National Park, she must reckon with a system that routinely dismisses the rights of convicted mothers --- and has their children pay the price."

Sarah Langan returns to her horror roots with a cautionary tale set in the near future that is truly spine-tingling. A BETTER WORLD introduces a broken, dystopian world not unlike ours where a new community has risen with their own solutions for staving off extinction in the face of global and geological cataclysm. If you have ever read anything about so-called perfect, idyllic societies or watched \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d then you have experienced the prospect of a too-good-to-be-true situation. The problem is that it almost always is. That is the same horror that the Farmer-Bowens family must experience here, as they relocate from deadly New York to Plymouth Valley. This walled-off community is run by BetterWorld, a company that makes a polymer called Omnium. Its main ingredient is recycled plastic, and it\u2019s used for such things as rope, clothing, bags and machine parts. \"Sarah Langan returns to her horror roots with a cautionary tale set in the near future that is truly spine-tingling.... It is quite a ride, with Langan maintaining a tenuous finger on the pulse of a possible world to come that becomes the biggest horror story of all.\" The novel splices in various marketing and promotional materials from Plymouth Valley. The first one is pure propaganda trying to entice the like-minded with quotes like \u201cnamed the most beautiful place to live in North America three years in a row\u201d and \u201cself-sustaining farm.\u201d The community of approximately 4,500 also follow their own belief system, Hollow, which acts as a substitute religion. Additionally, they have created their own protein in the form of caladrius, which are monstrous hybrid chickens with sharp teeth. Russell, a science advisor; his wife, Linda, a part-time pediatrician; and 15-year-old twins Josie and Hip are being interviewed for consideration to be invited into Plymouth Valley. They obviously want Russell the most because of what he can do scientifically with Omnium, but the entire family must be on their best behavior because they work on an ultra-creepy merit system where those who do not earn their rank and stay in line are bounced out. Or worse. It is not much of a choice when the opportunity is presented to them, as the rest of the world is suffering through a great unwinding where annihilation seems to wait around every corner. Josie and Hip begin to sniff out the truth about Plymouth Valley first, followed shortly thereafter by Linda. One real red flag are the Pagan-like rituals that the community follows with fervor. They have an offering schedule, broken up into four seasons, that replaces any traditional religious observance. They also have two feasts that include violence. Samhain, the original name for Halloween, features a deadly maze. The 5K run on Thanksgiving, which every resident from ages 10 to 90 must participate in, takes the slowest runner and uses that person for future culling. This would occur at their biggest event: the three-day Winter Festival, where the whole town lives together in the bunker-like tunnels that run beneath the community. Linda is very curious about the Winter Festival, but she can\u2019t get a straight answer from anyone about what takes place. All she knows is that some sort of sacrifice needs to be made for the greater good. She just assumes that it\u2019s a theoretical sacrifice, like an ugly caladrius. Once they crown their annual Beltane King --- a sadistic role that leads to the punishment parts of the rituals previously mentioned --- Linda knows that she and her family are in big trouble. She just can\u2019t get past the fact that Russell has drunk the Kool-Aid and doesn\u2019t see a problem with any of this. Langan includes various articles from journals written in the near and far future, which speak about Plymouth Valley in the past tense and the tragedy that occurred there. It is obvious that we are going to live through those events along with the Farmer-Bowens. Every relationship that Linda attempts to make goes terribly wrong, and she is soon on the outs with the elders of the community. Josie is having an equally hard time and is caught vandalizing a sign during the Samhain festivities. Hip is trying to integrate and even has a new girlfriend, but he reluctantly admits that it is all in an attempt to help out his mother with the powers that be. As the Winter Festival approaches, the underlying dread that Langan has created begins to bubble and boil out of control as it becomes obvious that there will not be a happy ending for the Farmer-Bowens. It is quite a ride, with Langan maintaining a tenuous finger on the pulse of a possible world to come that becomes the biggest horror story of all. Reviewed by Ray Palen on April 13, 2024"

        "review": " Whenever I review a new title from David Baldacci, I always marvel at how this prolific writer remains fresh and interesting with each release. That being said, his latest novel, A CALAMITY OF SOULS, is completely different. It took him 10 years to complete, and it may be not only one of his finest books to date, but quite possibly his most important. Two sheriff\u2019s deputies from Freeman County, Virginia, open this story with the apprehension and brutal beating of a Black man who has been arrested as the only possible suspect in the murder of his elderly white employers. The accused is Jerome Washington, and the victims are the extremely wealthy Leslie and Anne Randolph. \"There are so many twists in this unpredictable thriller, with some serious instances of human depravity sprinkled in for good measure, that it reads like a literary classic.\" Defense attorney John Robert Lee, who goes by Jack, has been making a name for himself but is about to become aligned with a case that seems impossible to win or receive any justice for. While visiting his parents, he receives a message that Miss Jessup had called there for him and needed to speak with him. She has been known to the family for decades and is a well-respected maid to one of their neighbors. Jack and his father take a ride to the Black part of town to meet with Miss Jessup. She proceeds to tell Jack that her son-in-law, Jerome, was wrongfully arrested for the Randolphs\u2019 murder. Employed by them as a handyman, he found their bloodied, lifeless bodies in their bedroom as deputies arrived. The law wants to railroad Jerome for this gruesome double homicide and is already threatening the death penalty. Jack meets with Jerome and is shocked by how badly beaten and injured he is. The assigned defense attorney did nothing to help Jerome and merely moved along with the prosecution\u2019s case. Jack believes Jerome, a decorated Vietnam veteran, and agrees to defend him. Keep in mind that the book\u2019s setting is the late 1960s, shortly after the assassinations of MLK and RFK, when there is little to no chance for a Black man in these circumstances to escape the death penalty in the South. As Jack begins to look into the matter, he receives almost a complete wall of resistance and hatred. When the prosecution brings in a heavy hitter from out of town, he realizes the magnitude and importance of this case. And the likelihood of an all-white jury does not make this uphill task any easier. Assisting Jack is Desiree DuBose, a Black lawyer who specifically works on racially charged cases such as this one. She is well-educated, well-spoken and unlike anything the courthouse in Freeman County has ever seen. Not only does this unwinnable case weigh on Jack, his team is faced with dirty surprise upon dirty surprise. David Baldacci has done such an outstanding job plotting this lengthy tale that there is not much I can say about this intense case without giving away something juicy. There are so many twists in this unpredictable thriller, with some serious instances of human depravity sprinkled in for good measure, that it reads like a literary classic. A CALAMITY OF SOULS is indeed an important novel, one that Baldacci was born to write and a story to which only he could do justice. Reviewed by Ray Palen on April 18, 2024"

Bound in an unwanted marriage, Freya spends her days gutting fish but dreams of becoming a warrior. And of putting an axe in her boorish husband\u2019s back. Freya\u2019s dreams abruptly become reality when her husband betrays her to the region\u2019s jarl, landing her in a fight to the death against his son, Bjorn. To survive, Freya is forced to reveal her deepest secret: She possesses a drop of a goddess\u2019s blood, which makes her a shield maiden with magic capable of repelling any attack. And it\u2019s been foretold that such magic will unite the fractured nation of Skaland beneath the one who controls the shield maiden\u2019s fate. Believing he\u2019s destined to rule Skaland as king, the fanatical jarl binds Freya with a blood oath and orders Bjorn to protect her from their enemies. Desperate to prove her strength, Freya must train to fight and learn to control her magic, all while facing perilous tests set by the gods. The greatest test of all, however, may be resisting her forbidden attraction to Bjorn. If Freya succumbs to her lust for the charming and fierce warrior, she risks not only her own destiny but the fate of all the people she has sworn to protect."

Lord Rosemorran has purchased a wax figure of a beautiful reclining woman and asks Stoker to incorporate a clockwork mechanism to give the Rosemorran Collection its own Sleeping Beauty in the style of Madame Tussaud\u2019s. But when Stoker goes to cut the mannequin open to insert the mechanism, he makes a gruesome discovery: this is no wax figure. The mannequin is the beautifully preserved body of a young woman who was once very much alive. But who would do such a dreadful thing, and why? Sleuthing out the answer to this question sets Veronica and Stoker on their wildest adventure yet. From the underground laboratories of scientists experimenting with electricity to resurrect the dead in the vein of Frankenstein to the traveling show where Stoker once toured as an attraction, the gaslit atmosphere of London in October is the perfect setting for this investigation into the unknown. Through it all, the intrepid pair is always one step behind the latest villain --- a man who has killed once and will stop at nothing to recover the body of the woman he loved. Will they unmask him in time to save his next victim? Or will they become the latest figures to be immortalized in his collection of horrors?"

        "review": " Simone St. James, the bestselling author of such works as THE BOOK OF COLD CASES and THE SUN DOWN MOTEL, returns with her trademark blend of thriller and horror. MURDER ROAD is a decades-old ghost story set in a deserted town featuring an unlucky couple who just might be the key to ending it. As Eddie Carter drives their beat-up Pontiac down the interstate on the way to the Five Pines Resort on the shore of Lake Michigan, April cannot believe her luck. Not only has she escaped the transient, terrified years of her youth, she has just married the most tender, compassionate man she has ever met --- and his Army body doesn\u2019t hurt, either. The two began dating and got married in the same year, but neither would define their romance as a whirlwind. Between April\u2019s traumatic past and Eddie\u2019s own brushes with PTSD from his time in Afghanistan, their bond is no less love-filled but is much calmer than your average shotgun wedding. \"Simone St. James has an innate talent for blending genres without doing a disservice to either, and that is on perfect display in MURDER ROAD.\" The two know how to react effectively and efficiently, and despite their traumas, their insides are still waters. So when they make a few errant turns and end up on the wrong highway, it\u2019s no big deal. When they see a strange, glowing light in the woods, it just might be a local or a freak trick of the light. And when they see what they first believe to be a small man, and then a young woman, walking on the side of the desolate, deserted highway, they assume she just had one too many at the local watering hole. Aware of the dangers that young women face when alone, they agree to pull over and ask if she needs help, or at least a lift somewhere. She\u2019s not drunk, but she\u2019s not all there either. She wears an oversized jacket, and she seems confused but not stupid. When she reluctantly gets in their car, she tells them that her name is Rhonda Jean and she needs to go to a hospital. April realizes too late that the jacket is hiding a lot of blood. But Rhonda\u2019s next reveal is the most terrifying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d Almost immediately, headlights flash through their rear window, and a big, imposing black truck begins to approach their vehicle way too fast. Eddie quickly taps into his military training and goes silent, his focus only on speeding toward the nearest anything, even as the truck matches his speed and every turn point for point. Through sheer luck, the unlikely trio turns onto a back road and loses the truck, but their pursuer is the least of their worries. Eddie barely turns into the hospital parking lot before he and April realize two things: Rhonda is not going to survive her wounds, and they have just deposited a dying woman they don\u2019t know at the hospital, their car and their clothing all drenched in her blood. It\u2019s not a good look, and the local detectives are quick to call them on it. But this isn\u2019t your average mystery. Shortly after the local force begins to question April and Eddie, a menacing state police officer arrives, telling the town\u2019s police to back off and that this is officially a state police issue now. It\u2019s alarming, to say the least, but it also makes April and Eddie curious: Why have the state police taken such an interest, and why do they seem dead-set on pinning Rhonda\u2019s death on them? Oh, and there\u2019s the one thing that they aren\u2019t telling police, local or state. When the black truck passed them, Eddie saw a teenage girl in the truck bed, dirty and disheveled and screaming for help. So, as the police zero in on the newlyweds, April and Eddie embark on their own investigation --- not just into Rhonda or the truck, but also into the road where they first encountered her: Atticus Line. As locals are quick to inform them, this is not the first life that Atticus Line has taken; the deaths on the same stretch of road go back nearly 30 years. This leads April and Eddie to a homemade hostel for transient youth, to teenage girls who have been tracking the deaths on the road for longer than they even knew it existed, and even to the history of the police force. Each new clue and possible line of investigation dovetails into one disappearance and legend: that of the Lost Girl, Atticus Line\u2019s first victim, and more than likely the ghostly teenage girl Eddie saw screaming from the back of the truck. But even though deaths have been occurring on and off for years, April and Eddie are the only ones to ever discover a murder midway, and the only ones to have seen the Lost Girl and lived to tell the tale. It is obvious that something led them to Atticus Line, and they are powerless to ignore the clues that something dark has a hold on the deserted town\u2019s desolate road. But why did it choose them? Simone St. James has an innate talent for blending genres without doing a disservice to either, and that is on perfect display in MURDER ROAD. While the supernatural element is apparent early on, so too is the mystery and the obvious failings of the local and state police forces to figure it out. This combination is not just compelling, it's downright propulsive. St. James can occasionally dwell on her characters\u2019 extraneous backstories for a bit too long, but the pull of the classic mystery storyline and the ghoulish supernatural keeps the pacing fast and tight.

        "review": " At one point in Jayne Anne Phillips\u2019 NIGHT WATCH, a character in 1874 West Virginia observes, \u201cThe fighting has ceased, but not the grief.\u201d That short sentence encapsulates much about this book, which is largely concerned with the persistent repercussions of trauma after the American Civil War. Much of the novel centers on the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, where 12-year-old ConaLee arrives with her mother at the start of the story. ConaLee, whose mother has not really spoken in quite some time, is brought there by a man who insists that both ConaLee and her mother call him \u201cPapa,\u201d even though he\u2019s neither one\u2019s father. The mother and daughter have left ConaLee\u2019s young siblings --- a toddler and infant twins --- behind and disguised themselves as a wealthy woman and her orphaned companion. \"[Phillips\u2019] writing can be elliptical, requiring numerous rereadings to discern the depth of the action or emotion. Those rereadings reward the determined reader as the cumulative effect is one not only of historical veracity, but also of emotional truth.\" The reasons for the woman's silence, and for their arrival at the asylum, gradually come into focus, as the novel travels backwards in time to earlier years, both before and during the war. It also follows several different characters, most notably Dearbhla, an Irish healer, who has intimate quasi-maternal connections with both of ConaLee\u2019s parents, as well as a man we meet as \u201cThe Sharpshooter\u201d but whose actual identity and relevance only becomes clear later. The significance --- and malleability --- of names is a major theme of the novel, as various characters utilize new names to hide something, to take on a new identity, or to reinvent themselves. When she arrives at the asylum, ConaLee is instructed by Papa to call her mother \u201cMiss Janet\u201d and create a new name for herself. Several characters have the same names; their similarity or overlaps might happen by design or by accident. The name ConaLee chooses for herself is \u201cEliza,\u201d which, it turns out, carries a significance that she only learns much later. Some have names that only describe their functions: for example, the aforementioned \u201cSharpshooter\u201d or the titular \u201cNight Watch.\u201d Just as names converge and overlap, so do characters, as history resurfaces to inform the present. These namings and renamings can feel creative, liberating, almost playful. But NIGHT WATCH, perhaps unsurprisingly, also has a darker streak. Befitting a novel about a gruesome war, the book contains numerous scenes of violence --- not only violence on the battlefield but also sexual violence against women. These scenes can be difficult to read, but they help to underscore the multifaceted horrors of war and explain the ways in which the asylum serves as a place of fear but also of safety and refuge for women like ConaLee and her mother. Phillips did a lot of research for NIGHT WATCH --- including visiting the real-life asylum, which is now a national historic site --- and she includes archival photos and documents throughout the text. Her writing can be elliptical, requiring numerous rereadings to discern the depth of the action or emotion. Those rereadings reward the determined reader as the cumulative effect is one not only of historical veracity, but also of emotional truth. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on September 29, 2023"

        "review": " At various critical moments throughout this remarkable memoir co-written with Kim Green, Chantha Nguon reflects on the protracted but satisfying process of preparing and cooking handmade noodles the way her mother did. You couldn\u2019t shorten or hurry the method. If you did, the end product would betray a lazy cook in both its taste and its texture. Hence the title SLOW NOODLES, a lifelong metaphor for patience --- often unimaginably extreme patience --- amid a life of danger and uncertainty. Nguon describes her childhood self as a pampered and \u201csoft\u201d middle-class Cambodian girl growing up in the 1960s in her hometown of Battambang in the eastern region of Cambodia. The youngest of a large family, she learned early that no matter how prosperous life might be, a family\u2019s future was always invested in its boys. Girls were meant to serve and work domestically, even though there were many signs of change in the world beyond her home. \"At various critical moments throughout this remarkable memoir co-written with Kim Green, Chantha Nguon reflects on the protracted but satisfying process of preparing and cooking handmade noodles the way her mother did.... You will never read another food-inspired memoir like SLOW NOODLES.\" But by teaching her daughters unusually high standards of cooking and sewing, their mother --- a founding heroine of SLOW NOODLES --- equipped them to fend for themselves in an uncertain and misogynistic society that would soon be torn apart by decades of overlapping wars in Southeast Asia. Little did young Chantha know how critical those skills would become. While maintaining the compliant exterior demeanor expected of Cambodian women, she met every challenge by internally strategizing how to best deal with it in the moment. The deaths of her father, mother, sister and other close relatives came in cruelly rapid succession as the family\u2019s fortunes rapidly declined. She found herself alone as a vulnerable twenty-something adult, an internally displaced refugee in a war-ravaged country with dreams of escaping to Europe or North America. Those dreams were dashed at every turn, costing all of her meager savings each time. Virtually homeless, Nguon survived year after humiliating year by cooking for others. She somehow remembered the vast store of recipes taught by her mother, learning how to adapt them to the often sparse ingredients and conditions at hand. SLOW NOODLES recounts numerous examples of how her meals fed every level of Cambodia\u2019s disrupted society of the 1960s and \u201970s --- businesspeople, professionals, students, soldiers, fellow refugees, aid workers, and even prostitutes as young as 12 who were sold into sexual slavery by their destitute parents. While Nguon\u2019s life until middle age was an extraordinary patchwork of disasters and opportunities held together by her own dogged resilience, two pivotal influences stood out for me as I followed the breathless pace of her narrative. First, Nguon encountered Chan, a young man in similar straits who radically did not believe women to be inferior. He insisted on her keeping pace with him as they fled one precarious situation after another, survived acute hunger and jungle diseases, or worked long hours at tedious jobs to raise more travel money. Second, the pair encountered the international NGO, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, where they learned urgently needed paramedical skills and worked on and off for a number of years. Those skills would help them create new lives focused on helping others. Thrown together in times of dire necessity, Nguon and Chan\u2019s survival partnership gradually grew into a life relationship as well. They never made it out of Southeast Asia, instead returning to Cambodia to become rebuilders of their all-but-lost culture. Since then, they have established educational, medical and entrepreneurial programs, raised children of their own (who did, in fact, get to study and live overseas), and eventually created stable lives after decades of deprivation, fear and frustration --- experiences that Nguon emphasizes belong to all Cambodians of their era. So where do the book's nearly two-dozen recipes fit? Nguon shares them whenever a certain food played a major role in salvaging the mental or physical health of those among whom she found herself, in both good times and bad. Each dish comes with deep and indelible memories, especially the eponymous \u201cslow noodles.\u201d Its lessons sustained a life that otherwise might have dissolved, as forces much larger tried, but ultimately failed, to eradicate Cambodia forever. You will never read another food-inspired memoir like SLOW NOODLES. Reviewed by Pauline Finch on March 2, 2024"

When Amitav Ghosh began the research for his monumental cycle of novels, the Ibis Trilogy, 10 years ago, he was startled to learn how the lives of the 19th-century sailors and soldiers he wrote about were dictated not only by the currents of the Indian Ocean but also by the precious commodity carried in enormous quantities on those currents: opium. Most surprising of all, however, was the discovery that his own identity and family history were swept up in the story. SMOKE AND ASHES is at once a travelogue, a memoir and an essay in history, drawing on decades of archival research. In it, Ghosh traces the transformative effect the opium trade had on Britain, India and China, as well as the world at large. The trade was engineered by the British Empire, which exported Indian opium to sell to China to redress their great trade imbalance, and its revenues were essential to the empire\u2019s financial survival. Following the profits further, Ghosh finds opium central to the origins of some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations, of America\u2019s most powerful families and prestigious institutions (from the Astors and Coolidges to the Ivy League) and of contemporary globalism itself. Moving deftly between horticultural history, the mythologies of capitalism, and the social and cultural repercussions of colonialism, in SMOKE AND ASHES Ghosh reveals the role that one small plant has had in making our world, now teetering on the edge of catastrophe."

        "review": " Given the rate of divorce in America, it\u2019s not surprising that memoirs about marital strife are proliferating, which is bound to induce a sense of d\u00e9ja vu when yet another one appears. But when it happens to be written by an author as talented as Leslie Jamison and is as relentlessly candid and eloquent as SPLINTERS: Another Kind of Love Story, there\u2019s good reason to put aside any reservations and dive in. SPLINTERS is a multi-themed tapestry whose threads are woven with precision and grace. In it, Jamison wrestles with an ever-lurking army of her own demons, including her almost obsessive need to please, which is only one facet of her lifelong struggle to measure up to some external standard of excellence in her personal and professional lives. It\u2019s also the bittersweet story of Jamison\u2019s relationship with her daughter in the first two years of the child\u2019s life. This ground-level glimpse of the joys and difficulties of parenting in those early years is complicated here by the tensions of a marital fracture and her own intense ambition. Jamison primarily trains her keen attention on the difficult years following the end of her relatively brief marriage to novelist Charles Bock (referred to as \u201cC\u201d in her account). He came to their relationship after his first wife\u2019s long struggle with cancer that ended with her death. They married at midnight in a wedding chapel in his hometown of Las Vegas, and their daughter was born in the winter of 2017. This was not long before Jamison embarked with the newborn on a lengthy multi-city tour to promote her book, THE RECOVERING: Intoxication and Its Aftermath, an exploration of the relationship between substance abuse and creativity seen through the lens of her own alcoholism and sobriety. \"SPLINTERS is a multi-themed tapestry whose threads are woven with precision and grace.... Jamison digs deeply here, and SPLINTERS overflows with vivid imagery and descriptions that animate her recollections.\" A product of divorce herself, Jamison, not yet married as she entered her 30s, had \u201cwanted the solidity of what you couldn\u2019t undo,\u201d but it became evident well before their daughter\u2019s arrival that her marriage to C, nearly 15 years her senior, was foundering. Despite several years of couples counseling, she realized that the end was inevitable and that she would have to be the one to end it. Jamison frankly regrets that, in deciding to wed C after only six months, she \u201clistened to the part of myself that was falling in love, and ignored everything else.\u201d The reality of her marriage was that \u201canother woman\u2019s death was nestled inside every moment between us. It was the house we lived in,\u201d and her inability to repair the profound damage of that loss was one of the principal factors that doomed their union. Separated from C and freshly ensconced in a railroad one-bedroom sublet next to a firehouse, she quickly discovers how challenging the world of single parenthood will be, especially after she returns to her teaching job. She frequently yearns for a partner who can help share her burden, even as that need is balanced against the intensity of her devotion to her daughter. The soundtrack of her days is a kind of staticky buzz, as she acknowledges \u201chow the volatility of my life was a noise that drowned out all other frequencies.\u201d And yet, for all these tensions, one of the aspects of SPLINTERS that refreshingly distinguishes it from many divorce memoirs is the absence of vituperative score-settling. Despite references to C\u2019s anger (\u201cthe humidity of his unspoken rage\u201d) and descriptions of a couple of ugly scenes during the transfer of their daughter in their custody-sharing arrangement, she takes pains to emphasize his positive qualities. In the essays collected in THE EMPATHY EXAMS and MAKE IT SCREAM, MAKE IT BURN, Jamison\u2019s writing has always been distinctive for its specificity and effective use of sensory detail. She explains to her students that \u201cdigging underneath the cocktail-party version of a story was like turning over a smooth stone to get at the moss and dirt below.\u201d Jamison digs deeply here, and SPLINTERS overflows with vivid imagery and descriptions that animate her recollections. When she loses her sense of smell to COVID, she confesses to missing \u201cthe vegetable reek of a mold-spotted cucumber. The urine tang or compost stink of my daughter\u2019s drooping diapers.\u201d And in those same frightening early days of the pandemic, Jamison recalls her daughter \u201cpouring shards of pita chips down the neck of her rainbow llama pajamas\u201d or how she \u201cspent her days spearing Internet-delivered raspberries with the baby fork.\u201d Jamison reveals something of her post-separation dating life, including a relationship with a tall, tattooed musician who \u201cplayed torch songs in dive bars all over the world\u201d and refers to himself as a \u201cprofessional tumbleweed.\u201d It\u2019s an intensely physical encounter in which she vainly pictures herself in a contented domestic partnership with a man \u201cin love with the way he broke things\u201d and for whom monogamy isn\u2019t even a meaningful aspiration. In this relationship and one with a philosophy PhD turned hedge fund manager, she wrestles with her affinity for the unending passion of romantic life (she\u2019s a \u201ccreature designed to fall in love, over and over again\u201d) and the persistent need to please her partners, rooted in her relationship with her distant father. By the end of SPLINTERS, Jamison achieves a sort of hard-earned peace, moving away from the idea of a divinity \u201cwho would give me enough gold stars if I did enough good things, and toward the mother who\u2019d been here all along --- with less patience for my performances and more patience for everything else. I was living toward joy that was less about earning, and more about ambush. A joy you might call grace.\u201d As this memoir reflects, she\u2019s the kind of person --- and, above all, the kind of writer --- whose life certainly will never go unexamined. We\u2019re all the beneficiaries of that gift. Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg on February 23, 2024"

        "review": " At one point in THE ANGEL OF INDIAN LAKE, the final entry in Stephen Graham Jones\u2019 Indian Lake trilogy, Jade Daniels asks, \u201cDo you like scary movies, Mr. Holmes? I used to. Until I had to try to live through them.\u201d Our engaging, one-of-a-kind protagonist is talking out loud to one of her late teachers with whom she often has one-sided conversations. Jade is an expert in all things horror, a proud half-Native American, an ex-con, a current history teacher and, depending on who you ask, either the savior or the damnation of her hometown of Proofrock, Idaho. \"I have always been a huge fan of Stephen Graham Jones\u2019 work, but I truly applaud what he has accomplished with this trilogy and the tireless amount of work he needed to draw from to keep the constant horror references popping.\" If you have not read the previous two novels, MY HEART IS A CHAINSAW and DON\u2019T FEAR THE REAPER, then I highly recommend that you do so prior to diving into this one. Additionally, if horror and hearing non-stop about it through often obscure references is not your thing, then you should have a lot of fun educating yourself in this area. That means deep-diving way beyond just the Halloween and Scream franchises. Horror is the language of preference used by Jade, and for aficionados of the genre like me, she quickly will become your new hero if she isn\u2019t already. When we met Jade, she was the self-professed ultimate \u201cfinal girl,\u201d primarily due to her love of slasher movies and the uncanny survival instinct she gained from them. She has been able to thwart a serial killer in each of the first two books, and then another one, Dark Mill South --- following an unforeseen prison stint --- in DON\u2019T FEAR THE REAPER. Now, Jade has returned to Proofrock once again. While some of the players have changed, along with her surprisingly turning establishment and taking a job as a high school history teacher, the tragic history of Proofrock always looms overhead threatening to strike again. Bad things will happen, this time in the form of the legendary and feared Angel of Indian Lake. Jones refers to this quote from American professor and medieval history expert Carol Clover: \u201cThere\u2019s never been a final girl like this.\u201d I can think of no better way to define Jade, an extremely memorable character who makes a great impression on anyone who has followed her story. She is going to need every ounce of her willpower and encyclopedic knowledge of horror literature and films to battle the curse of the infamous Lake Witch that is back to punish Proofrock\u2019s hapless residents. Jade does not have many allies in this battle and has to join forces with the new sheriff to take on the evil that has returned. Initially, she is turned on to the threat because of the number of citizens who have disappeared or been tragically killed while exploring the town\u2019s dark past. This is all interspersed with non-stop horror references that will leave fanboys and fangirls giddy with joy. Another great storytelling gimmick Jones employs is various notes from Jade\u2019s record that explore her integration back into society post-prison and PTSD, as well as a full psychological profile on her that lets you know what the real world thinks of her. Her bill of mental health alone will have you second-guessing everything she does. All sorts of supernatural shenanigans get stirred up, which leads to an epic finale. There is never a dull moment in this final installment, and it will be difficult to say goodbye to Jade. I can only share what Jones noted about THE ANGEL OF INDIAN LAKE: It was \u201ctime to say goodbye to Jade Daniels.\u201d Whether this is bidding her a fond farewell or watching her ultimate demise, I will leave to the surprise of the lucky readers who have stuck with her through one of the most memorable horror series I have ever experienced. I have always been a huge fan of Stephen Graham Jones\u2019 work, but I truly applaud what he has accomplished with this trilogy and the tireless amount of work he needed to draw from to keep the constant horror references popping.

        "review": " Kelly Link, known as the \u201cmaster of the short story\u201d for bestselling works like GET IN TROUBLE and WHITE CAT, BLACK DOG, makes her novel debut with THE BOOK OF LOVE. Seven years in the making and at a whopping 640 pages, it is further proof that Link\u2019s masterly control of magic and mayhem knows no bounds. One year ago, young adults Laura, Daniel and Mo died, vanishing suddenly and without warning or explanation from their cozy seaside community aptly named Lovesend, Massachusetts. In the year since, their families have succumbed to grief, splintered into rage, and reformed in new configurations that willfully ignore the missing branches of their family trees. Susannah has struggled the most. She lost her sister, Laura; her occasional lover, Daniel; and her friend, Mo. Even more than her grief over her sister and friends, though, she senses that something else is missing: the truth. Although she dwells in Laura\u2019s room, tends to their depressed mother, and has ceased causing the trouble of her youth, she can\u2019t shake her lingering anger at her sister. Then, just as suddenly as they disappeared, the three youths find themselves in their brightly lit high school music classroom. They are being observed by their teacher, Mr. Anabin, a harmless, meandering sort of man known more for his corny affirmational t-shirts than his teaching abilities. The room is a welcome reprieve from the colorless, joyless space they have occupied for the past year. But where was that, why did they end up there, how are they back, and who is the fourth person now accompanying them? After being magically manifested by Mr. Anabin, this stranger tells them that he cannot recall his name or think of any others. Casting a glance around the music room, they name him Bowie. \"Full of mysteries and magical contracts both ancient and new, and characters whose lives move with and against time, this spellbinding novel upends and reinvents what fantasy can do and what it can be.\" But Bowie is not the last member to join their impromptu gathering. Just as they are getting their bearings and coming to terms with the world again, a great white dog enters the classroom before morphing into a human. The man is familiar and unfamiliar, known and unknown. He is the one who has watched over them for the last year, and he is not happy about their jailbreak. Without any explanation, Mr. Anabin and the dog-man, who the young adults find out is called Bogomil, strike a bargain: Laura, Daniel, Mo and Bowie will perform tasks to demonstrate their control of magic, truth and love. When their scores have been tallied, two will return and two will remain. Their first assignment is twofold: the nearly insurmountable task of trying to remember how they died and performing a bit of magic. Neither god nor man, Mr. Anabin has magicked the world into fitting them in again, inserting memories of full scholarships to a prestigious program at a private conservatory in Ireland into the minds of their families and former classmates. Laura, Daniel and Mo will return home as if nothing has happened, and Bowie (whoever he is) will complete his tasks alone. If it sounds like Bowie has drawn the short straw, that is only because you don\u2019t know what happened before Laura, Daniel and Mo disappeared. One year ago, Laura and Susannah Hand and Daniel Knowe were members of a band cleverly named My Two Hands Both Knowe You. On the night of their disappearance, tension was brewing as they performed at a local watering hole. Susannah, always attuned to chaos, had kissed an audience member as part of their act. This individual was Laura\u2019s longtime crush, and Susannah picked him with the intent of hurting her sister. Laura quickly kissed Daniel, Susannah\u2019s on-again, off-again lover, in retaliation. It\u2019s an interesting dilemma, certainly worthy of a soap opera or teenage romance. But is it enough to have landed Laura, Daniel and poor Mo, who had no romantic entanglements with any of the band members, in the afterlife, and now in this liminal space contained by bargains and contracts? No, but it\u2019s a start. What Laura, Daniel, Mo, Bowie and even Susannah don\u2019t know is that a sort of war has been brewing for centuries. Three-hundred years ago, a betrayal unbalanced the cosmos and heavens and set their fates into motion, long before they were even conceived or thought of. Alternating between the perspectives of our doomed protagonists and the supporting cast --- high priests, goddesses, lovers, classmates, and even bartenders and waitresses --- Link unfolds a narrative as eternal and timeless as a fairy tale, and as gripping and resonant as a current event. While the main conflict is the teens\u2019 deaths and their fight to return to mortality, Link dives deep into each of their lives to explore queer love, racism, blended families, sibling rivalry and so much more. There are many love stories here, and they span the breadth between lucky and unlucky, doomed and vindicated, but not all of them are romantic or even full of love. Anyone who has ever read a short story by Kelly Link knows that she is extremely talented. The recipient of a MacArthur Genius grant, she wields the title of \u201cgenius\u201d well, and this ambitious undertaking is no exception. THE BOOK OF LOVE is indeed a tome, yet her writing remains true to form: beautiful and transcendent, dreamlike and magical\u2026and rooted in universal, crystalline truths of fact and feeling. Written as a series of \u201cbooks\u201d --- the chapters are focused on single characters --- it reads like a fairy tale and a play, with the \u201cbooks\u201d moving against and in accordance to the others, allowing readers to really sink into each character the way you might get to know a new friend or lover. In composition and style, this is an enchanting and moving novel, though I\u2019ll be the first to admit that Link\u2019s attention to detail --- particularly the lives of her supporting characters --- can be unwieldy at best and totally distracting at worst. It\u2019s a testament to her control of her magic and her ability to contort and manipulate common words into magical configurations and spells that I still could not put the book down. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it wouldn\u2019t have been tighter (and certainly easier to hold) at a smaller page count. Full of mysteries and magical contracts both ancient and new, and characters whose lives move with and against time, this spellbinding novel upends and reinvents what fantasy can do and what it can be. But I cannot wait to see what Link does when she is more comfortable in this longer format and better able to restrain her narrative so that it matches her perfect, transcendent prose.

        "review": " Yangsze Choo's new novel, THE FOX WIFE, is an atmospheric and magical blend of Asian folklore, a mother\u2019s search for revenge, and the mystery of a missing girl. \u201cFoxes, people say, are wicked women.\u201d The year is 1908, and the Qing dynasty is in decline after ruling China for three centuries. The population, which considers the Qings to be invaders, has become restless, relying on old folk tales and superstitions for guidance rather than the Western sciences and technologies that have begun creeping across Japan and China. Unlike the changing world, with its battles for cities and titles, superstitions remain the same --- dependable and comforting --- and no superstition is quite as prevalent as that of the fox. In Northwest China, villagers still worship at fox shrines, consult mediums channeling fox spirits, and invoke exorcists to drive out particularly cunning ones. So naturally it makes sense that THE FOX WIFE is narrated in part by a fox. Possessing the keen ability of a fox to transform into a woman, Snow Hu has infiltrated a wealthy pharmaceutical family with an eye on vengeance. Some time ago, a photographer named Bektu Nikan commissioned the death of her child, her fox pup, and she has hunted him ever since. \"THE FOX WIFE is a brilliant, luscious exploration of identity, revenge and mortality. Choo achieves the perfect literary balance in her writing: lyrical and cadenced, but charmingly accessible.\" However, Snow is not the only hunter in town. Not too long after she arrives, the body of a decorated courtesan is discovered on the steps of a popular restaurant. Wearing a flimsy, beautiful dress and a beatific smile, the mysterious woman was unidentified when her case was closed and her body was buried. But since her death, the restaurant has fallen on hard times, with suspicious happenings plaguing their kitchen, their books and their clients. Desperate to preserve his business, the owner calls in Bao Gong, a renowned detective known for his ability to sniff out even the most convincing lie. What the owner doesn\u2019t know --- and what most of Bao\u2019s clients don\u2019t know either --- is that Bao\u2019s ability is neither learned nor practiced, but a gift given to him by a fox god as a child. Because his unique talent is so tightly tied to the legends of fox gods and spirits, he feels innately tied to these mystical beings. When he hears that a white fox appeared on the same night the woman died, his interest is piqued. But before he unveils the tie between the woman and the fox, he must identify her and learn how and why she died alone on the stoop that freezing night. With both Snow and Bao in Manchuria, their investigations lead them to the same name: Bektu Nikan. While Snow wants to murder the man who caused the death of her pup, Bao\u2019s course is a bit more complicated. He learns that the dead woman may be a sex worker who disappeared from a nearby brothel and that she recently had captured the fancy of Mr. Wang. This wealthy man is known for hosting glamorous parties with professional \u201centertainers,\u201d and he may be keeping a few of his favorite entertainers and courtesans locked away in his compound. With the body buried, Bao is in search of one specific clue: a photograph taken by Nikan. His sources tell him that Nikan is hiding in the remote Wu Village. Meanwhile, Snow\u2019s work as a maidservant to the matriarch of an esteemed family has put her in the crosshairs of another fox masquerading as a human. Her mistress seems keenly aware of the spirit world and distrusts her grandson\u2019s close friendship with the cunning, foxlike (oh so foxlike) Shirakawa, and she tasks Snow with determining the true nature of their friendship. Privately, Shirakawa (known to Snow as Shiro) tells Snow that he knows about her search for revenge, and he is willing to lead her to Nikan. But the photographer-murderer is now in Japan, where Shiro plans to take her mistress\u2019s grandson on \u201cbusiness.\u201d As her own plans for vengeance dovetail with her mistress\u2019s journey to Japan to protect her grandson, it would seem that luck is in Snow\u2019s favor. But she cannot shake the ominous feeling that trouble lies ahead. At the same time, as Bao approaches Wu Village, the overtones of foxes and lost girls start to fill him with the uneasy sensation that he\u2019s approaching a sort of shadow realm where lies and half-truths will be uncovered, and the line between life and death, civilization and wilderness, will be blurred, if not broken. What awaits Snow in Japan has dangerous repercussions. As Bao\u2019s investigation starts to uncover ties between the missing girl, the photographer and rumors of a beautiful, cunning white fox, it becomes apparent that the spirits have intervened. Alternating chapters between Snow\u2019s search for vengeance and Bao\u2019s search for answers, Yangsze Choo weaves an absorbing, atmospheric tale that is part love story, part mystery and all magic. THE FOX WIFE is a brilliant, luscious exploration of identity, revenge and mortality. Choo achieves the perfect literary balance in her writing: lyrical and cadenced, but charmingly accessible. Even as she details complex histories and various versions of popular mythologies, she welcomes and invites readers into the richness of her text, never obfuscating or overwriting her themes. The character of Snow is written with a wry, whimsical voice. While her search for revenge is enough to keep you reading, it is her clear-eyed observations on the imbalances between men and women (both as humans and as foxes) that give this novel serious heft and make it seem timely and inciting, even as it dives deep into China\u2019s storied history. It goes without saying that some suspension of disbelief is required here, but the payoff is worth double the cost of entry. Choo\u2019s masterly handling and control of her mythologies make suspension easy and belief rewarding. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on March 2, 2024"

Over the course of this series, King has created her own Holmes universe building on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s original stories. THE LANTERN\u2019S DANCE is special in that it is full of Holmes\u2019 history, and we learn much more about this iconic sleuth by the end of the book. Mary Russell is on crutches from a badly sprained ankle during a prior adventure. She and Holmes are off to France to visit his son, world-renowned artist Damian Adler. Newcomers to this series surely will be asking themselves, Holmes has a son? Stay tuned for more on that! \"THE LANTERN\u2019S DANCE is special in that it is full of Holmes\u2019 history, and we learn much more about this iconic sleuth by the end of the book.\" Russell and Holmes are met by a man wielding a shotgun who accompanies them to the house. But Damian and his family are not there. Apparently, they were forced to flee unexpectedly due to a personal threat. Thus we have our mystery, and Holmes goes off in search of Damian. Meanwhile, Russell and her bad foot remain at Damian's place. While exploring the empty house, she comes across crates of memorabilia in Damian's studio marked for Holmes' great-uncle, artist Horace Vernet. Much of this stuff is random, but Russell picks up a journal that will become quite eye-opening as she dives into it. Let's take a step back for a moment. Fans of Holmes most certainly will remember his old paramour and sometime adversary, Irene Adler, who he met in the story \"A Scandal in Bohemia.\" It turns out she carried a child belonging to Holmes and kept that fact hidden for many years. After her passing, Holmes connected with Damian, with whom he has a tenuous relationship at best. Still, family is family, and Holmes is worried about the safety of his son and grandchild. The journal that Russell is poring over was written many decades ago by a young woman named Lakshmi, who is half-Indian. She was being raised by a new family in a small village in India, but her story is full of mystery and secrets that, upon solving, will begin to reveal information about her and her connection to the Holmes legacy. One item in particular that is being referenced constantly is a spinning lantern. When a candle is placed inside it and it\u2019s spun around, various silhouettes are shown that each add a piece to Lakshmi's personal history and story. Meanwhile, Holmes locates Damian safely and (after much prodding) learns of the facts behind the threat that drove him away. I will not reveal any details here as they most assuredly will connect to the revelations that Russell is simultaneously discovering in Lakshmi's journal. When Lakshmi's fate is revealed to Russell, she realizes exactly where this story fits into the Holmes legacy. And it's a whopper! Though not your traditional Russell/Holmes mystery, THE LANTERN'S DANCE becomes a can\u2019t-miss read for any Sherlock Holmes fan. Reviewed by Ray Palen on February 17, 2024"

These are just some of the words I can use to describe the experience of reading James Patterson and Matt Eversmann\u2019s THE SECRET LIVES OF BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS. It is not just a tribute to those in the book trade but a literary pat on the back to anyone who loves books. The Author\u2019s Note provides some eye-opening statistics about the current state of reading in this country. If you live in the US, you are among only one in five who can read a book and are actually in the habit of reading books. Only 15 percent of registered voters read books. It makes you believe that this beautiful pastime is on the brink of extinction. That is, until you check out the dozens of testimonies from book lovers that fill these pages. \"THE SECRET LIVES OF BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS is the best example of 'preaching to the choir' nonfiction reading that I can recall.... I applaud Patterson and Eversmann for doing the leg work and communicating with all of these book lovers to share their stories and views.\" Alexis Sky speaks of the smell of books and how guests to her independent bookstore in upstate New York often comment on it as they enter. You just don\u2019t get that scent when you visit one of the chain or big-box bookstores. She also reflects on her love of books and her supportive parents who allowed her to have her own library card. One day, their local librarian called with a friendly heads-up that Alexis had checked out an \u201cadult\u201d book. She asked her father what the word \u201cether\u201d meant and then went on to describe the journey that the two characters were undertaking in the novel she was reading. When he realized that she was referring to Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, she indicated that it was like ALICE IN WONDERLAND for boys. He concurred and told her that when she was older, they would have a different conversation about it. Lorrie Roussin is a middle school librarian from Texas. She surmises that this is the ideal place and perfect age for young people eager to explore the new worlds that reading opens up to them. They also are not as distracted as high school readers, who have so much more competing for their leisure time. Judy Blume, who is now 84 years old and the owner of a bookstore in Key West Florida, talks about the transition from book writer to bookseller. She feels that it is more important to share the wonder of reading with as many people as possible rather than locking herself away for years in the solitary exercise of writing a new novel. Susan Kehoe from Browseabout Books in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, discusses how she must ask non-book-related questions in job interviews to make sure that any prospective employee realizes that it is not all glamour. Her staff must be full-service to keep their doors open, and this includes cleaning the toilets and the daily task of sweeping up the sand that has been tracked in by patrons. What also makes independent bookstores unique are the occasional pets that become beloved fixtures there. Sally Brewster of Park Road Books in North Carolina recalls when a reporter contacted her to do a story --- not about the store, but about Yola, the extremely popular resident dog. Nancy Moore from Barnes & Noble in Massachusetts talks about how her love of books has become a way for her to pass judgment on people she meets. She is instantly suspicious of a home where no books are visible or on display. The big chain bookstores serve an important role in reaching readers where there are no other options. Jessica Claudio of Barnes & Noble in Staten Island, New York, is the owner of the only bookstore on the island. Therefore, it plays the same role that a smaller bookstore might serve for the residents as the only game in town. A neighborhood bookstore needs to reflect its community. This is seen at the Astoria Bookshop in Astoria, Queens. Owner and founder Lexi Beach fights an uphill battle to represent the oft-underrepresented borough in which she lives, especially in comparison to the more popular and artsy Brooklyn and Manhattan. People love to read local. Bookstores and libraries face the pressure of deciding what to make available on their shelves --- which is not an easy task when there is constant pressure from either the woke population or the government deciding what should be allowable. Denver librarian Dodie Ownes puts it best: \u201cIf we are going to carry THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK, then we also have to carry LGBTQ materials, and that also means that we have to carry something about Holocaust denial.\u201d The last bookseller I will cover is the store that is the most personal to me in this book. Sarah Galvin and her husband, Marc, run The Bookstore Plus in Lake Placid, NY. This town is an international Olympic village, and I began shopping there as a child. My sister, another avid reader, lives up there in the Adirondacks, and she attends this bookstore frequently. It makes me smile to know that it\u2019s still there and supporting local authors like Jamie Sheffield, who regrettably passed away last month. I wish that I could give time to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work. THE SECRET LIVES OF BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIANS is the best example of \u201cpreaching to the choir\u201d nonfiction reading that I can recall. It celebrates what we, the readers, love about the experience of reading a great and memorable book. The connections it makes within a community, as well as to our own memories and past experiences, are immeasurable. I applaud Patterson and Eversmann for doing the leg work and communicating with all of these book lovers to share their stories and views. It gives me hope for the continued future of the world\u2019s greatest way to pass the time. Reviewed by Ray Palen on April 13, 2024"

        "review": " While there is a death at the very beginning of THE STARS TURNED INSIDE OUT, Nova Jacobs has much more in store for readers than a typical murder mystery. This very sophisticated novel takes place in Switzerland. In the CERN facility, physicists try to divide atoms into smaller and smaller pieces in an effort to find dark matter, a mysterious concept that most of us don't fully understand, where the death takes place. And while the cause of death is clear, how it happened is not. The story is told in pieces, perhaps a nod to the pieces of matter that the physicists at CERN study. We learn about the \"Now,\" when the death is being investigated, and the \"Before,\" with both clearly labeled as to dates. We eventually realize that many of the players here are not who they appear to be. Eve Marsh works closely with fellow CERN physicist Arnav Bose, but she is torn. While she loves her job, she wonders how important it is when the world is in a climate crisis. In her few spare moments, she works on climate science, but the physicists' lives are pretty much devoted to being in the lab. \"[T]he ending is perfect and exceptionally touching. THE STARS TURNED INSIDE OUT certainly will leave you thinking about our world, the possibility of other worlds, and what really is important in life.\" As the novel progresses, we learn about the social lives of those who work at CERN, their happy hours, their coffee breaks, and the mysterious chateau in the woods where Stephen Hawking stayed. Most of the physicists are postdocs who are working there through the auspices of different universities, like Howard Anderby, to whom Eve is immediately drawn. Howard also has experienced loss --- in his case, the loss of not just one parent like Eve, but both. There's something a bit off about him, and it's important to find out exactly why he\u2019s different. Because it\u2019s his death that is featured in the book\u2019s opening pages. In addition to Eve's point of view, we learn about the events through Sabine Leroux\u2019s eyes. Sabine is a private investigator who has close ties to Yvonne Faye, who runs CERN, and Chlo\u00e9 Grimaud, who is one of the heads of a group. These three women were close friends at university, and those ties still bind. Another brilliant character is Niels Thorne, a flamboyant, extremely well-dressed physicist of means whose desperate goal is discovering dark matter. The other scientists are derisive about the fact that he spends more time giving tours than actually doing scientific work, but he's a likable man nonetheless in his immaculate jackets and scarves. Unlike most murder mysteries, this one doesn't leave clues dropped about like Gretel's scattered breadcrumbs. Instead, the story develops gradually as we find out more about the characters and particle physics. It's a subject that many of us know nothing about, so put on your researcher shoes and be prepared to learn at least something about the science that happens at CERN. Then there is a fascinating link between the study of physics and the metaphysical as Jacobs presents us with ideas relating to a universal consciousness and infinite alternate universes. When you finish the book, you might just do what I did and go back to reread some parts of it because of the information we didn't know until the end of the novel. A few crumbs scattered, after all. Between the scientific information, the buildup of the characters, a love story, the metaphysical and the mystery, there's a lot to digest. But the ending is perfect and exceptionally touching. THE STARS TURNED INSIDE OUT certainly will leave you thinking about our world, the possibility of other worlds, and what really is important in life. Reviewed by Pamela Kramer on March 22, 2024"

        "review": " THE STORM WE MADE, Vanessa Chan\u2019s debut novel, is a startling, gripping and electrifying exploration of the British colonization of Malaya and its subsequent Japanese occupation. It is February 1945, and the teenage boys of Bintang, Kuala Lumpur, are starting to disappear. Cecily Alcantara, a mother of three, has watched for years as her beloved homeland is first colonized by the British (who are domineering yet quiet) and then, in a bid for independence, occupied by the Japanese (who are much more involved than their colonizing peers). But despite revolutions and uprisings, guerrilla attacks and war, she and her family --- Gordon, her husband; Jujube, her serious eldest daughter; Abel, her loping, playful teenage son; and Jasmin, the cheer and whimsy of the family --- have remained safe and stable. Their safety is further ensured by their skin. Though they\u2019re not the blotchy pink of the British, Cecily and Gordon are of Eurasian descent, and they are able to \u201cpass\u201d between the worlds of the colonized and the colonizers. Until the day 15-year-old Abel doesn\u2019t come home. This would shock any mother; Cecily is fearful, devastated and frantic, but not surprised. After all, she carved the path for Abel\u2019s disappearance 10 years earlier, and the guilt has seen her through ever since. \"THE STORM WE MADE is a sweeping, unflinching portrayal of a country condemned.... This is a stunning achievement of wartime fiction, of Asian culture, and, most of all, of the ways in which war causes us to accept pain as part of existence.\" Jumping back to the British occupation, Chan introduces a younger, more privileged Cecily. Gordon, a consummate follower, has secured a good role in the British public works department. While Cecily has no love for her colonizers, she recognizes that Gordon\u2019s devotion at least keeps her family fed, clothed, sheltered and alive. But this doesn\u2019t mean that she can\u2019t --- under her stifling ball gowns, luxurious jewelry and picture-perfect fa\u00e7ade of composure --- dream of something more: an independent Malaya, taken as seriously as nations like China and Japan and able to rule and govern itself. One night, after her husband has passed out drunk, Cecily meets Bingley Chan, an Asian man who, with his British accent, seems to have secured a curious level of respect from the Brits. But Cecily learns that he is no follower. His real name is General Fujiwara, and she finds in him not only a sparkling conversationalist and upper-echelon-friendly confidant, but also an ally. Before long, Cecily is collecting scraps of paper from Gordon\u2019s office, lines of gossip from his parties and hushed whispers from behind the closed doors of her home, and delivering them all to Fujiwara. Together, they plan to confront and toss out the British, making way for the Japanese, whom Fujiwara claims will free Malaya. As Cecily turns from housewife to informant, she discovers both a new level of nationalism she didn\u2019t know she possessed and something even more powerful: a purpose. But 10 years later, Japan has taken over, boys --- including Abel --- are disappearing, girls are taken from their homes to act as \u201ccomfort women,\u201d and citizens like Cecily and Gordon have lost their purpose and pride. No longer at the frontline of the revolution, Cecily takes a backseat as her children become the new voices of invasion and occupation, starting with Abel, who is now living (unbeknownst to his family) in Kanchanaburi Labor Camp on the Thailand border. Abel\u2019s light skin and bright eyes are no longer a sign of privilege, but a target, and he is brutalized in more ways than one by his Japanese captors. Back at home, Jujube, now a young woman, works in a tea house serving battered soldiers and well-meaning but intrusive missionaries and educators, her only reprieve from her broken home. Unable to dream of a real future, she turns to safeguarding Jasmin, whose innocence both protects her from the horrors of war and puts her at serious risk. She knows nothing of labor camps or comfort women, only that she is forced to shear her hair and hide in the basement whenever soldiers are in town. In a moment of rage, she runs away. Now two of Cecily\u2019s children are missing; her husband, once a proud public figure, has been demoted to hard labor; and Cecily knows it is time to face her role in the turnover from British colonization to Japanese occupation. THE STORM WE MADE is a sweeping, unflinching portrayal of a country condemned. Vanessa Chan takes great risks in revealing the brutalities and violence of war, and it is obvious that her research into Malaya, an incredibly underexplored setting for wartime fiction, is both meticulous and compassionate. She chronicles truly horrifying moments, yet none of her more tragic scenes are ever voyeuristic or gratuitous. Every scene, piece of dialogue and development has been carefully considered, clearly conveyed and breathtakingly delivered. This is a stunning achievement of wartime fiction, of Asian culture, and, most of all, of the ways in which war causes us to accept pain as part of existence. The price of innocence --- as Chan so convincingly demonstrates through Jujube, Abel and Jasmin --- is never worth it, and it is even worse when children are forced to pay without ever knowing why. Even more bracing is Cecily\u2019s character arc, in which an act of revolution and liberation becomes a shackle, and the collateral damage of her dreams for more is personified by the abuse of her children. In writing THE STORM WE MADE, Chan has accomplished many things, one even more laudable than the next: a spellbinding, epic work of historical fiction, and a call to action for readers to expand their World War II reading to other countries and cultures, where the effects of war were no less felt but never truly acknowledged.

        "review": " A quirky, literary love story like no other, one that veers wildly from contemporary Britain to Soviet Russia to a bizarre but recognizable future, from one of the UK\u2019s hottest young novelists. Rachel and Jaime: their story isn\u2019t simple. It might not even be their story. Augustus Fate, a once-lauded novelist and now renowned recluse, is struggling with his latest creation. But when Jaime and Rachel stumble into his remote cottage, he spies opportunity, imprisoning them inside his novel-in-progress. Now, the fledgling couple must try to find their way back home through a labyrinthine network of novels. And as they move from Victorian Oxford to a utopian Manchester, a harsh Russian winter to an AI-dominated near-future, so too does the narrative of their relationship change time and again. Together, they must figure out if this relationship of so many presents can have any future at all. THE WATERMARK is a heart-stopping exploration of the narratives we cling to in the course of a life, and the tendency of the world to unravel them. Kaleidoscopic and wildly imaginative, it asks: How can we truly be ourselves when Fate is pulling the strings?"

        "review": " Alice Robb was a student at the School of American Ballet in New York City during a period of relative calm. When she started taking lessons there (the feeder school for the New York City Ballet) in 2001, its founder, George Balanchine, had been dead for nearly 20 years. Still, the students and faculty would dress up and sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him, and many of the teachers considered themselves his disciples. \"DON'T THINK, DEAR will appeal to balletomanes and recovering dance students alike. Just as Robb does near the end of the book, readers will come away hopeful that perhaps this most rigid of art forms might finally become more flexible.\" But what really characterized the SAB and the NYCB, Robb contends, were darker remnants of Balanchine's approach, philosophy and methods. This included the essentially unattainable aesthetic ideal for his female dancers --- an insistence on an almost impossibly long, lean body, a small head, and feet with exaggerated arches. Anyone who has read much fiction or nonfiction about ballet (or watched films like\u00a0Black Swan) is no stranger to the extreme measures that serious dancers --- many of them young adolescents --- take as they strive for this aesthetic. But Robb goes farther than most, connecting their bodies not only to the pursuit for thinness but to their extreme tolerance for pain and their nearly supernatural level of spatial awareness. Robb also writes at length (and, for those of us who grew up idolizing NYCB ballerinas, with plenty of gossipy detail) about Balanchine's muses. Maria Tallchief, Suzanne Farrell and Gelsey Kirkland were the principal dancers who inspired his choreography, in many cases sharing his bed, and became household names. Robb chronicles the power dynamics at play in these women's lives and careers, and how those dynamics continued to shape expectations for ballet students like herself. The framing device for Robb's book is a photograph of herself and her SAB classmates, only a handful of whom went on to careers in dance. As Robb considers factors such as body image, injuries and romantic relationships swirling around the life of a competitive dancer, she checks in on those girls, now in their early 30s, to hear how they reflect on their training and discover how they've emerged from it. In some ways, DON'T THINK, DEAR resembles an addiction memoir. Some of Robb's subjects express relief that they got out before they could sustain too much damage. Others have done everything they could to stay in that world. Most agree that if they ever have daughters of their own, they'll discourage them from pursuing ballet. As for Robb herself, she has found joy in a profession --- writing --- that doesn't care if you've put on a pound or two or if your hair has fallen out of its bun. And she's taking tiny steps --- a bourr\u00e9e, if you will --- toward approaching ballet as something that might be freeing and even fun. DON'T THINK, DEAR will appeal to balletomanes and recovering dance students alike. Just as Robb does near the end of the book, readers will come away hopeful that perhaps this most rigid of art forms might finally become more flexible. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on March 3, 2023"

Gabriel Allon, once an Israeli intelligence officer and now an art restorer who had lived in this same seaside village, is asked by the British police to help with the investigation. When he determines that the provenance of a Picasso painting is at the bottom of Charlotte\u2019s murder, Gabriel must follow the clues --- through Marseilles, Corsica, Monte Carlo and, finally, London. He is joined by a team of trusted operatives and colleagues, including Christopher Keller and Sarah Bancroft, whom readers of previous installments in the series will remember. \"While the term 'caper' might be used to describe the first half of this well-crafted suspense novel...the second half reveals a darker plot that seems ripped from the pages of recent international scandals.\" While the term \u201ccaper\u201d might be used to describe the first half of this well-crafted suspense novel --- as databases are hacked, villains are run off the road, and forged paintings are secreted into the high-security Geneva Freeport --- the second half reveals a darker plot that seems ripped from the pages of recent international scandals. It involves huge sums of money hidden behind shell companies and the billionaires and oligarchs who keep law firms and financial institutions afloat while politicians turn a blind eye. It also highlights the role that journalists play in revealing these machinations, which is no surprise given Daniel Silva\u2019s own background as a journalist and TV news producer. Meanwhile, longtime readers will notice that Gabriel Allon has evolved into a multidimensional character. While able to stay one step ahead of a swarm of antagonists, he has a solid reputation in the art world and a real affection and appreciation for his many friends there, as well as for his faithful allies and, of course, his family. Similarly, Silva effortlessly juggles a series of plot twists while homing in on a range of serious topics --- from the motivations of those who buy (and, in some cases, steal) art, to the role of dark money in many countries\u2019 finances and politics.

        "review": " In the ruins of postwar Europe, the world's leading expert on the Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism goes on a hair-raising journey to recover sacred books stolen by the Nazis. At the end of the Second World War, Gershom Scholem, the magisterial scholar of Jewish mysticism, is commissioned by the Hebrew University in what was then British-ruled Palestine to retrieve a lost world. He is sent to sift through the rubble of Europe in search of precious Jewish books stolen by the Nazis or hidden by the Jews themselves in secret places throughout the ravaged continent. The search takes him into ruined cities and alien wastelands. The terrible irony of salvaging books that had outlasted the people for whom they\u2019d been written leaves Dr. Scholem longing for the kind of magic that had been the merely theoretical subject of his lamplit studies. Steve Stern's A FOOL\u2019S KABBALAH, a novel featuring numerous real-life historic figures, reimagines Gershom Scholem\u2019s quest and how it sparked in him the desire to realize the legacy of his dear friend, the brilliant philosopher Walter Benjamin. At the heart of that legacy was the idea that humor is an essential tool of redemption. In a parallel narrative, Menke Klepfisch, self-styled jester and incorrigible scamp, attempts to subvert, through his antic behavior, the cruelties of the Nazi occupation of his native village. As Menke\u2019s efforts collide with the monstrous reality of the Holocaust, we see --- in another place and time- --- evidence that Dr. Scholem, in defiance of his austere reputation, has begun to develop the anarchic characteristics of a clown. A FOOL'S KABBALAH intertwines the stories of these two quixotic characters, who, though poles apart, complement one another in their tragicomic struggles to oppose the supreme evil of history, using only the weapons of humor and a little magic."

You get the books in Alice Henderson\u2019s highly acclaimed series, the third installment of which is A GHOST OF CARIBOU. In each title, Henderson cleverly uses the group noun for the animal that Alex Carter is researching. She wrote about \u201ca solitude of wolverines\u201d and \u201ca blizzard of polar bears\u201d in the first two entries, and now the focus shifts to caribou. In addition to the fine writing and the characters I have come to care about, I love learning about the wildlife. Caribou? I had no idea that we had them in the US until I read this thrilling novel. As a wildlife researcher for the Land Trust for Wildlife Conservation, Alex is responsible for investigating different species. This time, she is studying whether or not there is a caribou in Washington State; one might have been spotted on a remote camera. We are given a lot of info about caribou and how they differ from similar species like deer and elk. \"Have I enjoyed this series? Absolutely. Do I relish the action and the mystery, and learning about the environment with details I wouldn't otherwise encounter? Indubitably.\" Henderson never lectures, and the lessons, so to speak, are delivered naturally as part of the process of Alex\u2019s work. But we come to care about the animals, and it's extremely frustrating to see the futility of our Federal Endangered Species Act and its decades-long inability to protect species that are endangered but have not been formally listed. The bureaucratic process works so slowly and inefficiently that there is a real possibility that species will go extinct before anything significant is done. Henderson writes, \"The Endangered Species Act was a valuable piece of legislation, but Alex had come to believe that its approach might be outdated. It dealt with species as if they were isolated problems to solve. In reality, things needed to be addressed in a more holistic way. What we need is an Endangered Ecosystem Act, she thought. Protection that addressed an entire ecosystem would benefit so many species at once: wolverines, mountain caribou, the American pika, and, of course, even human.\" This especially resonates with people like me who have been watching the indiscriminate slaughter of wolves in Montana this hunting season. Henderson is passionate about our environment, and she emphasizes the damage that climate change is causing not just in terms of more destructive and uncontainable wildfires, hurricanes and warmer temperatures, but to the wildlife itself. She points out that we are \"currently experiencing an insect apocalypse that was going largely unreported. Insects had declined by 75 percent in the last fifty years, due to loss of habitat, pesticide use, and climate change.\" Then she explains why this devastation is so frightening. The mystery is well done. When Alex arrives at the land that the Trust has purchased, a dead body is found in town. She is asked to keep an eye out for a hiker who went missing the previous year as mysterious lights fly through the forest at night. One local is convinced that aliens are responsible, but knowing that Henderson is a scientist, we don\u2019t think that's where the story is headed. But there are times when we want to scream at Alex for taking unnecessary chances. She knows there is danger in the area yet stays out overnight. She also doesn't tell the local sheriff about the lights at first, and we're not sure why. The writing is engaging as Henderson describes the sights and aromas in the wild: \"Here, towering western red cedar and western hemlock trees grew to immense proportions, lichen hanging off their branches. The soil smelled damp and earthy, and she lingered, reveling in being out here in the mountains, the crisp air on her face.\" Have I enjoyed this series? Absolutely. Do I relish the action and the mystery, and learning about the environment with details I wouldn't otherwise encounter? Indubitably. Do I think that newcomers should read each book chronologically? Yes. That way, they truly will get to know Alex Carter's background and what she does, which will only add to their appreciation of the series. Reviewed by Pamela Kramer on December 3, 2022"

It also was so much fun to watch the series on Prime Video, where the horrific crimes Antonia worked were brought to life. Now, Antonia and her partner in the Red Queen project, Jon Guti\u00e9rrez, are back on another case at the behest of their leader, Mentor. Antonia\u2019s brain is not wired like normal people. She can see and hear on multiple plains simultaneously, which makes it extremely difficult for any clue or motive to get past her. However, this skill set also has its drawbacks. She is constantly on special medications to regulate the bizarre things she sometimes visualizes, typically a bunch of wild monkeys. It has taken such a toll on her mentally that she takes solace in spending three solid minutes a day contemplating different ways of killing herself. \"This might be the first time in Antonia\u2019s life that she is truly scared because she is facing a foe who not only is ruthless but also appears to be completely soulless.\" At the start of BLACK WOLF, Antonia meets up with Jon, who has just fished out a female corpse from the Manzanares River in Madrid. As usual, she arrives a little late but quickly takes charge. She assesses the situation and starts to figure out what the first detective on the scene and the forensics squad failed to catch. Before they can get caught up in this investigation, Mentor lets Antonia and Jon know that they are being reassigned to another case six hours away that is a high priority. It also has something to do with the Russian mob, which is an ongoing battle that groups like the Red Queen project must face. A Russian group known as the Orlov Gang has gotten themselves into some sort of deadly feud that has left former police officer Anatoly Oleg Pastushenko dead as he was gunned down while guarding his boss\u2019s wife, Lola Moreno. Lola was married to Yuri Voronin, a big player in the Russian mob who was murdered in a separate incident. The very pregnant Lola is now on the run in her native Spain and is not sure who she can trust. Antonia and Jon are to immediately locate Lola and bring her in before she is silenced by whoever is attacking the Russian clan she married into as a young trophy wife. The individual who is spearheading this total elimination is not someone to be trifled with and has spared no expense in hiring a special assassin to finish the job by killing Lola --- a vicious executioner known only as Black Wolf. It might surprise some readers to learn that Black Wolf is a Russian female operative and assassin who has some things in common with Antonia. She is having trouble focusing due to the pain in her spine as the result of a mishap on a prior case. As such, the first time we see Black Wolf, she is waking up in a room in Madrid. It takes a bit of time before she realizes where she is. She then is visited by a man who proceeds to deliver painful injections into her lower back and spinal region that will provide her with the temporary relief necessary to complete her mission. G\u00f3mez-Jurado deftly sets up an extended version of cat-and-mouse that will ramp up each chapter until someone or several people are dead. Antonia has to use different skills in BLACK WOLF, like code-breaking and figuring out some of the shenanigans the Russian mob has been involved with regarding spyware, but nothing will prepare her for Black Wolf. This might be the first time in Antonia\u2019s life that she is truly scared because she is facing a foe who not only is ruthless but also appears to be completely soulless. This outstanding trilogy will wrap up with the release of WHITE KING, which I hope will be published as soon as possible. Hold on for another wild ride! Reviewed by Ray Palen on March 22, 2024"

KILLING THE WITCHES revisits one of the most frightening and inexplicable episodes in American history: the events of 1692 and 1693 in Salem Village, Massachusetts. What began as a mysterious affliction of two young girls who suffered violent fits and exhibited strange behavior soon spread to other young women. Rumors of demonic possession and witchcraft consumed Salem. Soon three women were arrested under suspicion of being witches --- but as the hysteria spread, more than 200 people were accused. Thirty were found guilty, 20 were executed, and others died in jail or their lives were ruined. KILLING THE WITCHES tells the dramatic history of how the Puritan tradition and the power of early American ministers shaped the origins of the United States, influencing the founding fathers, the American Revolution and even the Constitutional Convention. The repercussions of Salem continue to the present day, notably in the real-life story behind The Exorcist and in contemporary \u201cwitch hunts\u201d driven by social media. The result is a compulsively readable book about good, evil, community panic, and how fear can overwhelm fact and reason."

        "review": " A compelling story of family, home and the bond between sisters that asks: Who do you believe when you can't even trust yourself? When Jess was 13, her mother went for a walk and never returned. Jess and her older sister, Liz, never found out what happened. Instead, they did what they hoped their mother had done: survive. As soon as she was old enough, Jess fled their small town of Knife River, wandering from girlfriend to girlfriend like a ghost in her own life, aimless in her attempts to outrun grief and confusion. But one morning, 15 years after their mother\u2019s disappearance, she gets the call she\u2019s been bracing for: Her mother\u2019s remains have been found. Jess returns to find Knife River --- and her sister --- frozen in time. The town is as claustrophobic and rundown as ever. Liz still lives in their childhood home and has become obsessed with unsolved missing persons cases. Jess plans to stay only until they get some answers, but their mother\u2019s bones, exposed to the elements for so long, just leave them with more questions. As Jess gets caught up in the case and falls back into an entanglement with her high school girlfriend, her understanding of the past, of Liz, of their mother and of herself become more complicated --- and the list of theories more ominous. KNIFE RIVER is a tense, intimate and heartrending portrayal of how deeply and imperfectly women love one another: in romantic relationships, in friendships and especially as sisters."

        "review": " Each year, there are debuts that impact readers. Occasionally, some of these titles earn year-end praise in the form of Best Debut Novel awards. MY NAME WAS EDEN by Eleanor Barker-White is a book that you should make note of, as I would not be surprised if this uniquely devised novel is remembered and honored when 2024 comes to a close. I have always been intrigued by stories involving twins. But Barker-White takes a different approach to this topic by placing an uncommon occurrence at the center of this dark and cunning psychological thriller. \"MY NAME WAS EDEN is the sort of creepy, deeply affecting novel that will invade your thoughts and dreams long after you have turned the stunning final pages.\" The creepy Prologue provides imagery of a nameless male figure who has been lurking in the shadows and is about to make himself known. This plays directly into the action of the story, which kicks off immediately when teenager Eden is discovered floating face down in the lake behind her farmhouse in the British countryside. Her mother, Lucy, screams for help, and initially it appears that she is dead. Incredibly, paramedics are able to revive Eden and get her to the hospital where she ends up making a full recovery. However, Eden is changed by this traumatic experience and not just physically. She starts claiming to her parents from her hospital bed that she was once Eden but is now Eli. This hits directly to Lucy\u2019s heart, as she had been carrying what looked like twins during her pregnancy years earlier, but just one child was left in her womb. The doctors referred to it as vanishing twin syndrome, where the stronger of the two fetuses absorbs the weaker one in the womb. Had Lucy given birth to twins, who had been identified by sonograms as female and male, they would have been named Eden and Eli. Lucy\u2019s husband, David, is not having any of this Eli nonsense and cannot understand why his daughter is using this name. Lucy\u2019s mother-in-law, Anna, does not give in to this new complication of identity and blames Lucy for Eden\u2019s near death in a passive-aggressive way. Nevertheless, everyone notices that things are different, especially the dynamic between Lucy and Eden. They never really got along before, but suddenly they are now close. Eden\u2019s return also leads to changes at school, specifically the relationship between her best friend, Charlie, and Charlie\u2019s crass boyfriend, Alex, whom Eden despises. When Alex dies after being struck by a vehicle, eyebrows are raised, and Lucy is directly involved in this tragic incident. Her strange behavior makes for many more complications, most of which are noticed only by Lucy. David is in avoidance mode not only because of his refusal to bow down to his daughter\u2019s insistence on being called Eli, but also out of guilt when it comes to an alleged affair that Lucy swears he is having with a younger coworker. Barker-White continues to infuse her book with mystery and suspense that is never predictable, even when you think you know where the story is taking you. MY NAME WAS EDEN is the sort of creepy, deeply affecting novel that will invade your thoughts and dreams long after you have turned the stunning final pages. I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us next! Reviewed by Ray Palen on March 9, 2024"

Williams introduces us to an enigmatic woman named Saint, a fearsome conjuror who, in the 1830s, annihilates plantations all over Arkansas to rescue the people enslaved there. She brings those she has freed to a haven of her own creation: a town just north of St. Louis, magically concealed from outsiders, named Ours. It is in this miraculous place that Saint\u2019s grand experiment --- a truly secluded community where her people may flourish --- takes root. But although Saint does her best to protect the inhabitants of Ours, over time, her conjuring and memories begin to betray her, leaving the town vulnerable to intrusions by newcomers with powers of their own. As the cracks in Saint\u2019s creation are exposed, some begin to wonder whether the community\u2019s safety might be yet another form of bondage. Set over the course of four decades and steeped in a rich tradition of American literature informed by Black surrealism, mythology and spirituality, OURS is a stunning exploration of the possibilities and limitations of love and freedom by a writer of capacious vision and talent."

Still grieving the death of her husband, and reluctant to settle just to make her life easier when she knows it\u2019s not best for her small son, she takes a job at newly minted Horsethief Trail National Park in Oklahoma. A law enforcement ranger, Val is the only woman on the force. While she does her best to fit in, she is continually faced with sexist and derogatory remarks. Val also wasn't expecting to walk straight into a mystery. After her arrival, the bodies of three children are found in a far-off cave in what most believe to be a ritual burial, a hiker goes missing, and a foster child in town known for her lies is constantly on her mind. Val finds a friend among the Choctaw Tribal Police force, who helps her make inroads among the locals and track down leads in the case. \"Wingate does a heartfelt job of telling both Ollie and Val\u2019s stories and showing how change finds us all in the end, especially when we fight to make that change real.\" In 1909, 11-year-old Olive Augusta Radley chooses to take matters into her own hands and leave the relative safety of her home to protect her adopted sister, six-year-old Nessa. Their stepfather is a cruel man, and after the mysterious disappearance of her other adopted sister, Ollie realizes that being on their own is the safer option. She plans their escape, but things go sideways. They find themselves running not only from their stepfather, but from others trying to catch them. After a harrowing chase down the river, Ollie and Nessa meet up with a small group of youngsters living in the woods. A band of Choctaw and abandoned children, the little community is simply looking for safety and shelter in the woods. Ollie, while skeptical at first, decides there is safety in numbers, so they stay together. While only 11, Ollie is old enough to work and does what she can to keep everyone safe while trying to stay hidden herself. When they all start to relax into their new lives and routines, tragedy strikes once more. Ollie and Nessa again find themselves running and alone. I love when novelists allow their audience to see characters from different eras and perspectives. In SHELTERWOOD, Lisa Wingate takes readers on an emotional ride through time. We feel Val\u2019s grief and uncertainty as she tries to find a place for herself and her young son after her husband passes away. She pushes forward hoping to find solace in her work. Ollie is running to safety, doing all she can to keep Nessa out of the hands of their stepfather and along the way manages to find a family among the abandoned children roaming the woods. You feel the rage and the hurt, and you understand why Val and Ollie are running toward new lives. Wingate brings the story full circle, and while happy endings are few and far between for these individuals, there is a lot of closure. While it doesn\u2019t erase the hurt, it does bring understanding, which is what makes this story so lovely. SHELTERWOOD is about finding different paths, building new lives, and the heartbreak that is also part of the journey. Additionally, it shines a light on the women who were fighting for needed change in a world built and controlled by men. It\u2019s not always an easy book to read --- many parts are sad and disturbing --- but Wingate does a heartfelt job of telling both Ollie and Val\u2019s stories and showing how change finds us all in the end, especially when we fight to make that change real.

        "review": " As I was reading THE 24th HOUR, I had the strangest feeling that I was holding two books in my hand. In today\u2019s tough economy, two books for the price of one is a pretty good deal. Then I surmised that James Patterson and Maxine Paetro must have spun their own separate stories and merged them in this highly unique mashup. THE 24th HOUR is indeed the 24th entry in the Women\u2019s Murder Club series. For the uninitiated, the Women\u2019s Murder Club is comprised of SFPD Sergeant Lindsay Boxer, Medical Examiner Claire Washburn, Assistant District Attorney Yuki Castellano, and crime writer Cindy Thomas. Each of these powerful women deals with murder and other crimes on an almost daily basis, so any opportunity for them to get together and share notes on a current case is sure to be explosive --- and fodder for Cindy\u2019s next story. \"THE 24th HOUR is another quick and relentless read from the dynamic duo of Patterson and Paetro. It is quite unpredictable, and it was a pleasure getting reacquainted with Lindsay, Claire, Yuki and Cindy.\" Lindsay, Claire, Yuki and Cindy are at a restaurant celebrating Cindy\u2019s engagement to one of Lindsay\u2019s pals, longtime friend and partner Rich Conklin. However, their fun get-together is cut short when they hear screams coming from the second floor. They find a mostly disrobed woman on the ground, obviously the victim of an assault. She utters the troubling words \u201cHe raped us.\u201d This leads to a search of the entire place and ends with the discovery of a man with no pants stuffed behind a locker trying to hide. He is Tyler Cates, an employee of the restaurant, who claims that the young lady requested that he engage in rough sex with her in the changing room. The victim\u2019s legal name is Mary Elena Hayes, but during her initial interview with the Women\u2019s Murder Club, she jumps between names like Loretta and Lily. Mary Elena suffers from and is being treated for dissociative identity disorder (DID), which explains why she referred to herself as \u201cus.\u201d Her many \u201calters\u201d will only appear when she requires protection, which is what happens here. Yuki and her second chair, Nick Gaines, plan to defend Mary Elena in court. They are filled with much trepidation as most judges and juries do not believe in or support multiple personality disorder as a defense. To take it a step further, prosecutor Ed Schneider is described by Yuki as a pit bull and is not one to give clinical or scientific value to DID should it come up. If any of Mary Elena\u2019s alters emerge during the testimony, he will laugh and tear Yuki\u2019s case to shreds. To make matters even trickier, there are no medications to handle DID, which also will not help the defense. Cates is not a credible individual by any stretch of the imagination, but Yuki and her legal team are walking a slippery slope. Under normal circumstances, it would be a slam dunk for them. Despite these challenges, things are going well, and the Women\u2019s Murder Club is doing their fair share to assist. Thankfully, no issues with unexpected alters have derailed the proceedings just yet. But then, out of the blue, while Mary Elena is testifying, Cates jumps up and begins shouting. His outburst includes accusations that, if true, could blow up the entire case for all involved. As all of this drama is unfolding, Lindsay is investigating the high-profile murder of a billionaire couple. However, while fascinating in its own right, I found myself much more captivated by the DID storyline than I was with this one. I have always been intrigued by fiction revolving around multiple personalities. It provides a great plot point in thrillers and legal-themed novels, and probably was best used in William Diehl\u2019s 1993 book, PRIMAL FEAR. THE 24th HOUR is another quick and relentless read from the dynamic duo of Patterson and Paetro. It is quite unpredictable, and it was a pleasure getting reacquainted with Lindsay, Claire, Yuki and Cindy. Reviewed by Ray Palen on May 18, 2024"

Peggy and Molly Gainsborough --- the daughters of one of England\u2019s most famous portrait artists of the 1700s and the frequent subject of his work --- are best friends. They spy on their father as he paints, rankle their mother as she manages the household, and run barefoot through the muddy fields that surround their home.

        "review": " Young novelists who write a well-received first book inevitably face high expectations when it comes time to deliver their second. In the case of Tommy Orange, that pressure is only intensified by the fact that his 2018 debut, THERE THERE, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and won the National Book Critics Circle\u2019s John Leonard Prize for best first book in any genre. While not without its flaws, his sophomore effort, WANDERING STARS, turns out to be both a moving family story and an excavation of historic wrongs that reveals how trauma reverberates down through the generations until it must be confronted in the present. Superficially, WANDERING STARS appears to be two books uneasily joined together. Indeed, it\u2019s only about midway through the novel, which features in its second half several characters who appeared in THERE THERE, that Orange\u2019s narrative strategy starts to emerge. That\u2019s a warning to impatient readers who may be wondering when the story is going to take a recognizable shape to hang on for its plentiful rewards. \"...a moving family story and an excavation of historic wrongs that reveals how trauma reverberates down through the generations until it must be confronted in the present.\" Orange opens the novel with the story of a member of the Cheyenne tribe who takes the name Jude Star after surviving the Sand Creek Massacre on November 29, 1864 and two generations of his descendants. In that unprovoked surprise attack, some 230 Cheyenne and Arapaho tribespeople, most of them women, children and the elderly, were slaughtered by U.S. Army forces. In one of the novel\u2019s epigraphs, Orange quotes Theodore Roosevelt, who, while conceding \u201ccertain most objectionable details\u201d of the event, went on to describe it as \u201con the whole as righteous and beneficial a deed as ever took place on the frontier.\u201d It\u2019s that shameful attitude that informs the treatment of survivors like Jude, who flees Sand Creek with a bullet still lodged in him. After he surrenders to the U.S. military, he\u2019s sent to a \u201cprison-castle\u201d in Florida run by Richard Henry Pratt, a Civil War officer and veteran of the American Indian Wars. Pratt became the founder and first superintendent of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, a boarding school in Pennsylvania whose most famous resident for nine years was athletic legend Jim Thorpe. Pratt\u2019s odious philosophy was that you \u201ckilled the Indian to save the man,\u201d even as he claimed he wanted to \u201cmake the country see the worthiness of Indians.\u201d Beginning with personal grooming and clothing, Pratt --- his prejudice cloaked in benevolence --- viewed his job as one that involved erasing all traces of his students\u2019 Native American heritage. Jude\u2019s son, Charles, is a student at the school and dreams of becoming a writer so he can tell his father\u2019s story but struggles in a life that\u2019s marred by his criminal conduct and an addiction to laudanum. Whether in the form of a novel or nonfiction, the story of the monstrosity that was the Carlisle School is one that deserves to be told by a writer of Tommy Orange\u2019s talent, much as Colson Whitehead did to a similarly horrific institution in his novel, THE NICKEL BOYS. The fact that Orange, an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, chose not to tell that story in full here might engender some disappointment. But in fairness, that\u2019s not the book he\u2019s chosen to write. Instead, about a third of the way through the novel, Orange abruptly --- and at first jarringly --- shifts to his hometown of Oakland, California, in 2018. It\u2019s there that Orvil Red Feather is recovering from a gunshot wound he received at the Big Oakland Powwow that ended THERE THERE. Like his ancestor Jude Star, the bullet remains precariously lodged in his body. Orvil lives, along with his brothers Loother and Lony, in the home of their great-aunt Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield. She has assumed at least informal custody of the boys after their grandmother has disappeared and their mother, a drug addict, died by suicide. Orange skillfully shifts viewpoints among the members of this loving but troubled family to reveal how both the personal and historic pasts echo in their lives. At the Catholic high school that Opal, a mail carrier, has borrowed money to enable him to attend, Orvil befriends a fellow student, Sean Price, whose father runs a drug laboratory in the basement of his home. Together, the boys slip into a life of addiction and drug dealing that echoes the travails of Orvil\u2019s ancestor, Charles. Both Orvil and Sean, who\u2019s the brown-skinned adoptee of a white family and whose 23andMe DNA test reveals some intriguing information about his genetic heritage, live with the pain of losing their mothers in childhood. Each must consider how the trauma of the Native American past is reflected in their lives. As Orvil recognizes, \u201c[S]ome wounds were bottomless holes asking to be filled every day,\u201d an apt summary of the struggles of the Star, Red Feather and Bear Shield families. WANDERING STARS is a story of survival, but as Opal reflects, \u201c[S]urviving wasn\u2019t enough. To endure or pass through endurance test after endurance test only ever gave you endurance test passing abilities. Simply lasting was great for a wall, for a fortress, but not for a person.\u201d But for all its darkness, Orange chooses to end the novel on a note of hope, with Orvil\u2019s brother Lony\u2019s wish that they may \u201clearn to forgive ourselves, so that we lose the weight, so that we might fly, not as birds but as people, get above the weight and carry on, for the next generations, so that we might keep living, stop doing all this dying.\u201d It\u2019s a thought that serves as a kind of benediction, even as the story it concludes is far from reaching its end.

        "review": " It isn\u2019t until the very end of WINDSWEPT --- in her Acknowledgments, actually --- that UK writer Annabel Abbs references the onset of COVID-19 and its impact on the final trek in her ambitious project to physically trace the routes of eight extraordinary walking women of the 19th and 20th centuries. Yet there could be no better mental and muscular challenge to the inertia, apathy and sedentary despair that so many of us have experienced as this global pandemic stretches into its second full year. Health experts and social scientists have seen a hopeful rise in solo walking as an intentional activity with demonstrable benefits for both psychological and physical health and few, if any, social distancing limitations. Abbs also points out the bodily demands (sometimes overwhelming) and benefits (sometimes surprising) of experiencing other women\u2019s lives through her feet. But the real journey began in her head. Like the iconic American social historian and intrepid walker Rebecca Solnit, whose writings on her own foot journeys helped fuel her determination to put a female stamp on the oldest form of human locomotion, Abbs found herself increasingly frustrated by the near-invisibility of women who walked not only out of necessity, but on purpose. \"...one of the most exhilarating and masterful reflections ever on how to meaningfully move on our own feet and the remarkable women who made this a unique expression of their being.\" With her children all nearing adulthood and faced with the prospect of being an \u201cempty nester,\u201d Abbs became emotionally and intellectually invested in understanding the inner drive of eight famous and lesser-known women who chose walking in order to experience a universe beyond motherhood and homemaking --- Frieda von Richthofen, Gwen John, Clara Vyvyan, Daphne du Maurier, Nan Shepherd, Simone de Beauvoir, Emma Gatewood and Georgia O\u2019Keefe. Raised in rural Wales by parents who for years disdained car ownership and other \u201cmod cons,\u201d Abbs had walking ingrained in her almost from the time she could stand on her own. As she grew up, went away to school, worked, married, raised a family and achieved success as an award-winning journalist, magazine writer and novelist, walking as a pursuit in and of itself receded into the background. Her epiphany happened as she recovered from a serious fall and head injury; she again would take up long-distance walking as a personal passion and involve her family as well. While her partner and children were supportive, if not always as enthusiastic on the ground, Abbs soldiered on, building stamina and endurance. But more importantly, she steadily deepened her inner knowledge of how other women used their feet to nurture and expand their identities. After reading numerous hiking, trekking and walking memoirs nearly all by men, she gathered this small but powerful group of female writers, artists, teachers, poets and philosophers, all of whom left scattered paper trails of their personal journeys. Over years of painstaking research, including getting access to documents never before published, Abbs focused her efforts on bringing their journeys to light in WINDSWEPT. She simply could have created a series of thumbnail biographies around their little-known (or totally unknown) walking escapades, but the project became much more personal than that. Abbs resolved to follow, as best she could, some of the main rural and urban routes each of these eight women had travelled and reflect on them as more than mere historical events. And she would do so with the bare minimum of equipment and supplies, just as they had done in previous centuries. That in itself was a big ask for someone used to 21st-century high-tech outdoor clothing and electronic GPS gadgetry. It would not be a 100% \u201cpure\u201d historical re-creation, but she never short-changed the actual walking, even when time had erased many of the landmarks her historical mentors would have known. Travelling, often alone, through Britain, southern Europe and the harsh desert landscapes of the southwestern United States, Abbs noticed a fascinating intersection of her precursors\u2019 experiences with 21st-century realities. Then and now, there was gratification, fear, wonder, relief, fatigue, exhilaration, despair and fulfilment. She notes emphatically that men who write walking memoirs never mention fear; women, she surmises, are the braver for doing so. Especially compelling about the book\u2019s prose is its clarity and frankness about the vulnerability of the unaccompanied female body on foot. Abbs doesn\u2019t shy away from commenting on the same challenges faced by her historic walking mentors, who had to deal with menstruation, relieving themselves, finding safe places to sleep, or avoiding predatory male attention. None were postmenopausal when they undertook their legendary journeys. If I could be allowed one \u201cnitpick\u201d in WINDSWEPT, it\u2019s the book\u2019s total lack of maps or pictures of the women and places Abbs writes about. But as a timely inspiration for all of us to get off the couch and walk --- somewhere, anywhere --- just for the sake of it, it\u2019s one of the most exhilarating and masterful reflections ever on how to meaningfully move on our own feet and the remarkable women who made this a unique expression of their being.
