AND MRS. DOCTOR. When 276 schoolgirls are abducted from their school in Nigeria, Fidelis Ewerike, a Florida-based barrister, poet and former POW of the Nigerian Civil War, begins to go mad, consumed by memories of his younger sister, Ugochi, who went missing during that conflict. Consumed by survivor\u2019s guilt and fearful that the same fate awaits Amara, his 16-year-old daughter who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ugochi, Fidelis locks her in her bedroom, offering no words of explanation, only lovingly --- if poorly --- made meals and sweets. Amid that singular action, the Ewerike family spirals into chaos. After unsuccessful attempts to free her daughter from her room, his wife, Adaobi, seeks the counsel of a preacher, praying for spiritual liberation from the curse she is certain has plagued her family since leaving Nigeria. Fourteen-year-old Chuk, beset by his own war with the neighborhood boys, receives a painful education on force, masculinity, and his tenuous position within his family. And rebellious, resentful Amara is hungry for her life to be hers, so the moment she is able to escape her imprisonment, she falls in love --- not with the Aba-born engineer-in-training her mother envisages, but with Maksym Kostyk, the son of the town drunk. Before long, the two have concocted a plan to run away from the trappings of their familial traumas. Perfect for readers of SING, UNBURIED, SING, Julie Iromuanya's A SEASON OF LIGHT is an all-consuming masterpiece. To peer into the window of the Ewerike family\u2019s lives is a gift."

Professional baseball has featured a bevy of superstars over the past century and a half, but only a few of them have impacted their sport and cities as deeply as Willie McCovey and Billy Williams. Born just a handful of miles apart in 1938, they grew up in and around one of the sport\u2019s true cradles, Mobile, Alabama, on their way to producing two iconic careers in Major League Baseball. In A TIME FOR REFLECTION, Jason Cannon examines these two legends of the game. Overcoming the heinous racism of the Jim Crow South as part of the second generation of African American major leaguers who followed in the footsteps of Jackie Robinson, they became two of baseball\u2019s all-time greatest players. Off the field, they took impactful stands for racial progress that continue to resonate today. Their personal resolve, leadership in the clubhouse and dedication to their baseball communities endeared them to teammates and fans alike. Featuring original interviews with family members, friends, teammates and Williams himself, A TIME FOR REFLECTION brings to life their monumental accomplishments on the diamond, while also detailing how McCovey and Williams grew into pillars of San Francisco and Chicago and inspired future generations of ballplayers."

And anyone incurably obsessed with books understands this kind of unsettling literary encounter. Sarah calls books that have this effect \u201cLife Ruiners.\u201d Her Life Ruiner, Toni Morrison\u2019s THE BLUEST EYE, became a talisman for her in high school when its electrifying treatment of race exposed Sarah\u2019s deepest feelings about being Japanese American in a predominantly white suburb of Cleveland. But Sarah had always lived through her books, seeking escape, self-definition and rules for living. She built her life around reading, wrote criticism, and taught literature at an Ivy League University. Then she was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown, and the world became an unreadable blank page. In the aftermath, she was faced with a question. Could we ever truly rewrite the stories that govern our lives? BIBLIOPHOBIA is an alternately searing and darkly humorous story of breakdown and survival told through books. Delving into texts such as ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, POSSESSION, A TALE FOR THE TIME BEING and THE LAST SAMURAI, Chihaya interrogates her cultural identity, her relationship with depression, and the intoxicating, sometimes painful, ways books push back on those who love them."

Birdie is keeping it together; of course she is. So she\u2019s a little hungover, sometimes, and she has to bring her daughter, Emaleen, to her job waiting tables at an Alaskan roadside lodge, but she\u2019s getting by as a single mother in a tough town. Still, Birdie can remember happier times from her youth, when she was free in the wilds of nature. Arthur Neilsen, a soft-spoken and scarred recluse who appears in town only at the change of seasons, brings Emaleen back to safety when she gets lost in the woods. Most people avoid him, but to Birdie, he represents everything she\u2019s ever longed for. She finds herself falling for Arthur and the land he knows so well. Against the warnings of those who care about them, Birdie and Emaleen move to his isolated cabin in the mountains, on the far side of the Wolverine River. It\u2019s just the three of them in the vast black woods, far from roads, telephones, electricity and outside contact, but Birdie believes she has come prepared. At first, it\u2019s idyllic and she can picture a happily ever after: Together they catch salmon, pick berries, and climb mountains so tall it\u2019s as if they could touch the bright blue sky. But soon Birdie discovers that Arthur is something much more mysterious and dangerous than she ever could have imagined and that like the Alaska wilderness, a fairy tale can be as dark as it is beautiful. BLACK WOODS, BLUE SKY is a novel with life-and-death stakes, about the love between a mother and daughter, and the allure of a wild life --- about what we gain and what it might cost us."

But decades ago, during the Urban Wars, he was part of a small, secret organization called The Twelve. Responding to an urgent summons from an old compatriot, he landed in New York and eased into the waiting car. And died within minutes. Lieutenant Eve Dallas finds the Rossi case frustrating. She has an elderly victim who just arrived from Rome; a widow who knows nothing about why he left; an as-yet unidentifiable weapon and zero results on facial recognition. But when she finds a connection to the Urban Wars of the 2020s, she thinks Summerset --- fiercely loyal, if somewhat grouchy, majordomo and the man who rescued her husband from the Dublin streets --- may know something from his stint as a medic in Europe back then. When Summerset learns of the crime, his shock and grief are clear --- because, as he eventually reveals, he himself was one of The Twelve. It\u2019s not a part of his past he likes to revisit. But now he must --- not only to assist Eve\u2019s investigation, but because a cryptic message from the killer has boasted that others of The Twelve have also died. Summerset is one of those who remain --- and the murderous mission is yet to be fully accomplished."

Jennifer Finney Boylan, the bestselling author of SHE'S NOT THERE and co-author of MAD HONEY with Jodi Picoult, examines the divisions --- as well as the common ground --- between the genders and reflects on her own experiences, both difficult and joyful, as a transgender American. SHE'S NOT THERE was the first bestselling work written by a transgender American. Since its publication 20 years ago, Jennifer Finney Boylan has become the go-to person for insight into the impact of gender on our lives --- from the food we eat to the dreams we dream, both for ourselves and for our children. But CLEAVAGE is more than a deep dive into gender identity; it\u2019s also a look at the difference between coming out as trans in 2000 --- when many people reacted to Boylan\u2019s transition with love --- and the present era of blowback and fear. How does gender affect our sense of self? Our body image? The passage of time? The friends we lose --- and keep? Boylan considers her womanhood, reflects on the boys and men who shaped her, and reconceives of herself as a writer, activist, parent and spouse. With heart-wrenching honesty, she illustrates the feeling of liminality that followed her to adulthood, but demonstrates the redemptive power of love through it all. With Boylan\u2019s trademark humor and poignancy, CLEAVAGE is a sharp, witty and captivating look at the triumphs and losses of a life lived in two genders. It provides hope for a future in which we all have the freedom to live joyfully as men, as women and in the space between us."

When Kate Gies was four years old, a plastic surgeon pressed a synthetic ear to the right side of her head and pulled out a mirror. He told her he could make her \u201cwhole\u201d --- could make her \u201cright\u201d --- and she believed him. From the ages of 4 to 13, she underwent 14 surgeries, including skin and bone grafts, to craft the appearance of an outer ear. Many of the surgeries failed, leaving permanent damage to her body. In short, lyrical vignettes, Kate writes about how her \u201cdisfigured\u201d body was scrutinized, pathologized and even weaponized. She describes the physical and psychic trauma of medical intervention and its effects on her sense of self, first as a child needing to be fixed and, later, as a teenager and adult navigating the complex expectations and dangers of being a woman. IT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL TO BE FINISHED is the story of a girl desperately trying to have a body that makes her acceptable and of a woman learning to own a body she has never felt was hers to define. In an age of speaking out about the abuse of marginalized bodies, this memoir takes a hard look at the role of the medical system in body oppression and trauma."

Many cultural and religious traditions expect those who are grieving to step away from the world. In contemporary life, we are more often met with red tape and to-do lists. This is exactly what happened to Geraldine Brooks when her partner of more than three decades, Tony Horwitz --- just 60 years old and, to her knowledge, vigorous and healthy --- collapsed and died on a Washington, D.C. sidewalk. After spending their early years together in conflict zones as foreign correspondents, Geraldine and Tony settled down to raise two boys on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The life they built was one of meaningful work, good humor and tenderness, as they spent their days writing and their evenings cooking family dinners or watching the sun set with friends at the beach. But all of this ended abruptly when, on Memorial Day 2019, Geraldine received the phone call we all dread. The demands were immediate and many. Without space to grieve, the sudden loss became a yawning gulf. Three years later, she booked a flight to a remote island off the coast of Australia with the intention of finally giving herself the time to mourn. In a shack on a pristine, rugged coast, she often went days without seeing another person. There, she pondered the various ways in which cultures grieve and what rituals of her own might help to rebuild a life around the void of Tony\u2019s death. A spare and profoundly moving memoir that joins the classics of the genre, MEMORIAL DAYS is a portrait of a larger-than-life man and a timeless love between souls that exquisitely captures the joy, agony and mystery of life."

At the turn of the 20th century, Vivian Lesperance is determined to flee her origins in Utica, New York, and avoid repeating her parents' dull, limited life. When she meets Oscar Schmidt, a middle manager at a soap company, Vivian finds a partner she can guide to build the life she wants --- not least because, more interested in men himself, Oscar will leave Vivian to tend to her own romances with women. But Vivian's plans require capital, so the two pair up with Squire Clancey, scion of an old American fortune. Together they found Clancey & Schmidt, a preeminent manufacturer of soap, perfume and candles. When Oscar and Squire fall in love, the trio form a new kind of partnership. Vivian reaches the pinnacle of her power building Clancey & Schmidt into an empire of personal care products while operating behind the image of both men. But exposure threatens, and all three partners are made aware of how much they have to lose. For readers of Hernan Diaz's TRUST and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's THE MAGICIAN, with echoes of Gustave Flaubert and E.M. Forster, MUTUAL INTEREST is a beguiling story of queer romance, empire and power."

Psychologist Alex Delaware and Homicide Detective Milo Sturgis race against time to find a twisted killer in this riveting thriller from the #1 New York Times bestselling \u201cmaster of suspense\u201d (Los Angeles Times). People come to Los Angeles to chase their dreams. Sometimes they find themselves cast into a nightmare. And sometimes, the most ardent dreamers turn out to be the most vicious monsters. The body of an aspiring actress is found dumped near a hospital emergency room. She\u2019s been drugged and murdered, and the motive for the callous crime remains maddeningly out of reach. Until a prime suspect materializes. Another Hollywood hopeful. Only to be shot dead by a sniper using a weapon that turns out to have been catalogued in a previous murder. And another before that. It\u2019s not long before more bodies begin piling up. What makes the murderous spree baffling is the apparent lack of connection among the victims. Is this the work of a random thrill killer, the toughest of all cases to unravel? But as Alex and Milo dig deeper they\u2019re faced with an even knottier scenario: a highly complex killer with deep-seated motivation that will require all of their highly honed skills to decipher. The latest page-turner from #1 New York Times bestseller Jonathan Kellerman is a tale of psychological complexity, dark suspense and shocking surprises. A wild ride through L.A.\u2019s surreal underbelly climaxed by an edge-of-the chair conclusion."

With one still in a German prison camp, the other wrote a book about it --- a memoir built on fabrications. Now the bestselling author of EIGHTY DAYS shares their incredible, never-before-told full story. Etta Shiber and Kate Bonnefous are the unlikeliest of heroines: two seemingly ordinary women, an American widow and an English divorc\u00e9e, living quietly together in Paris. Yet during the Nazi occupation, these two friends find themselves unexpectedly plunged into the whirlwind of history. With the help of a French country priest and others, they set out to rescue British and French soldiers trapped behind enemy lines --- some of whom they daringly smuggle through Nazi checkpoints hidden inside the trunk of their car. Ultimately the Gestapo captures them both. After 18 months in prison, Etta is returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange. Back home, hoping to bring attention to her friend Kitty\u2019s bravery, she publishes a memoir about their work. PARIS-UNDERGROUND becomes a publishing sensation and Etta a celebrity. Meanwhile, Kate spends the rest of the war in a Nazi prison, entirely unaware of the book that has been written about her --- and the deeds that have been claimed in her name. In researching this story, Matthew Goodman uncovered military records and personal testimonies that reveal, for the first time, the shocking truth behind Etta\u2019s memoir and the unexpected, far-reaching consequences of its publication. More than just a story of two women\u2019s remarkable courage, PARIS UNDERCOVER is a vivid, gripping account of deceit, betrayal and personal redemption."

Armed with this insight, she allows herself to look with the eye of an artist at the wounds she suffered and come to understand the transformational power this has to restore her soul. By turns candid and lyrical, stoic and forgiving, blunt and evocative, READING THE WAVES reframes memory to show how crucial this process can be to gaining a deeper understanding of ourselves."

Gravesend, Brooklyn, 1986: Risa Franzone lives in a ground-floor apartment on Saint of the Narrows Street with her bad-seed husband, Saverio, and their eight-month-old baby, Fabrizio. On the night Risa's younger sister, Giulia, moves in to recover from a bad breakup, a fateful accident occurs: Risa, boiled over with anger and fear, strikes a drunk, erratic Sav with a cast-iron pan, killing him on the spot. The sisters are left with a choice: notify the authorities and make a case for self-defense, or bury the man's body and go on with their lives as best they can. In a moment of panic, in the late hours of the night, they call upon Sav's childhood friend --- the sweet, loyal Christopher \"Chooch\" Gardini --- to help them, hoping they can trust him to carry a secret like this. Over the vast expanse of the next 18 years, life goes on in the working-class Italian neighborhood of Gravesend as Risa, Giulia, Chooch and eventually Fabrizio grapple with what happened that night. A standout work of character-driven crime fiction from a celebrated author of the form, SAINT OF THE NARROWS STREET is a searing and richly drawn novel about the choices we make and how they shape our lives."

In the tradition of EVICTED and INVISIBLE CHILD, Jeff Hobbs masterfully explores America\u2019s housing crisis through the real-life story of Evelyn. This is Hobbs\u2019 first book since THE SHORT AND TRAGIC LIFE OF ROBERT PEACE that focuses on a single character and her extraordinarily illuminating journey. In 2018, poverty and domestic violence cast Evelyn and her children into the urban wilderness of Los Angeles, where she avoids the family crisis network that offers no clear pathway for her children to remain together and in a decent school. For the next five years, Evelyn works full time as a waitress yet remains unable to afford legitimate housing or qualify for government aid. All the while she strives to provide stability, education, loving memories and college aspirations for her children even as they sleep in motels and in her car, living in fear of both her ex and the nation\u2019s largest child welfare agency. Eventually Evelyn encounters Wendi Gaines, a recently trained social worker who decades earlier survived her own abusive marriage and housing crisis. Evelyn becomes one of Wendi\u2019s first clients, and the relationship transforms them both. Told from the perspectives of Evelyn, Wendi, and Evelyn\u2019s teenage son, Orlando, SEEKING SHELTER is a powerful and urgent exploration of the issues of homelessness, poverty and education in America --- a must-read for anyone interested in understanding not just social inequality and economic disparity in our society but also the power of a mother\u2019s love and vision for her kids."

        "review": " A fun, sophisticated illustrated collection of essays that catalogs the simple and not-so-simple pleasures of the eclectic world of candy from the award-winning author of AFTER THE ECLIPSE. With illustrations by Forsyth Harmon. A taxonomy of sweetness, a rhapsody of artificial flavors, and a multi-faceted theory of pleasure, SWEET NOTHINGS is made up of 100 illustrated micro essays organized by candy color, from the red of Pop Rocks to the purple Jelly Bonbon in the Whitman\u2019s Sampler. Each entry is a meditation on taste and texture, a memory unlocked. Everyone\u2019s favorites --- and least favorites --- are carefully considered, including Snickers and Trader Joe\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, as well as the beloved Good n\u2019 Plenty and Werther\u2019s Originals. An expert guide and exquisite writer, Sarah Perry asks such pressing questions as: Twizzlers or Red Vines? Why are Mentos eaters so maniacally happy? And in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, how could Edmund sell out his siblings for, of all things, Turkish delight? She rejects the dreaded \u201cWhat is your favorite candy?\u201d question and counters: Under what circumstances? The question itself is flawed --- favorite under what circumstances? In what weather? On the road, or at home? In what mood? For candy is inextricably tied to the seasons of our lives. SWEET NOTHINGS moves associatively, touching on pop culture, art, culinary history, philosophy, body image and class-based food moralism. It challenges the very idea of \u201cjunk\u201d food and posits taking pleasure seriously as a means of survival. Sarah Perry\u2019s pure love of candy weaves together elegiac glimpses of her '90s childhood --- and the loss at its center --- with stories of love and desire. Surprisingly smart and frequently funny, SWEET NOTHINGS is a tart and sweet ode to finding small joys where you can. Yes, even in black licorice."

Strays, Mama calls them. People who have strayed too far from the road. Mama loves the strays. She feeds them wine and keeps them warm. Then she satisfies her burning appetite by picking apart their bodies. But Mama\u2019s want is stronger than her hunger sometimes. And when a beautiful, white-toothed stray named Eden turns up in the heart of a snowstorm, Margot must confront the shifting dynamics of her family, untangle her own desires, and make her bid for freedom. With this gothic coming-of-age tale, debut novelist Lucy Rose explores how women swallow their anger, desire and animal instincts --- and wrings the relationship between mother and daughter until blood drips from it."

And no one is more sympathetic than a mother whose child faces a life-threatening illness. But what if the mother is the cause of the illness? What if the sympathy is the point? Munchausen by proxy (MBP) has fascinated and horrified both professionals and the general public since this disturbing form of child abuse was first identified. But even as the public has been captivated by these tales of abuse and deception, there remains widespread misinformation and confusion about MBP. Are these mothers unfeeling psychopaths, or sick women who need help? And more important, how can we protect the children whose lives are at stake? THE MOTHER NEXT DOOR offers a groundbreaking look at MBP from an unlikely duo: a Seattle novelist whose own family was torn apart by it, and the Texas detective who has worked on more medical child abuse cases than anyone in the nation. Readers ride along on three high-stakes MPB investigations; through riveting reporting and shocking stories from the family members, friends and doctors caught in the blast zone of these unthinkable acts, a twisted portrait of motherhood and deceit is revealed. With help from some of the top MBP experts in the world, Dunlop and Weber uncover the complex maze of psychological, systemic and cultural issues that compound MBP and offer solutions for how we might find our way out."

A couple for 30 years, their \"separate but together\" partnership is running up against the realities of late middle age: Grant\u2019s mother has died, the college where he taught philosophy was shuttered, and their twin girls are grown and gone. Escaping the bitter cold of a Midwestern winter for the hot desert sun of Palm Springs seems as good a solution as any to the more intractable problems they face. When they arrive at Le Desert, a quirky condo community where everyone knows everyone\u2019s business, Kim immediately embraces the opportunity to make new friends and explore a more adventurous side of her personality. Meanwhile, Grant struggles to find his footing in this unfamiliar landscape, leaving Kim to wonder if their relationship can survive the snowbird season. But when Grant goes missing on a hike in the Palm Springs mountains, Kim is forced to consider two terrifying outcomes: either Grant is truly lost, or this time, he\u2019s really left her. Is it ever too late to become the person we wanted to be --- and is there still time to change into someone better? The exhilarating but often confusing transitions of midlife are pitched against the promise and glamour of Palm Springs in this tender, honest story of what it takes to commit to someone for a lifetime. With compassion and humor, Clancy explores the redemptive power of finding ourselves, and of being found."

They came alone when they needed to get away from each other, and together when they had something important to discuss. The Park has been their witness for half a century of love. Until now. Jane is dying, and Abe is recounting their life together as a way of keeping them going: the parts they knew --- their courtship and early marriage, their blossoming creative lives --- and the parts they didn\u2019t always want to know --- the determined young student of Abe\u2019s looking for a love story of her own, and their son, Max, who believes his mother chose art over parenthood and who has avoided love and intimacy at all costs. Told in various points of view, even in conversation with Central Park itself, these voices weave in and out to paint a portrait as complicated and essential as love itself. An homage to New York City, to romance and even to loss, THIS IS A LOVE STORY tenderly and suspensefully captures deep truths about life and marriage in radiant prose.

In an aging timber house hand-built into the Absaroka-Beartooth mountains, two brothers are struggling to keep up with their debts. They live off the grid, on the fringe of Yellowstone, surviving off the wild after the death of their father. Thad, the elder, is more capable of engaging with things like the truck registration, or the medical bills they can\u2019t afford from their father\u2019s fatal illness, or the tax lien on the cabin their grandfather built, while Hazen is\u2026different, more instinctual, and deeply in tune with the natural world. Desperate for money, they are approached by a shadowy out-of-towner with a dangerous proposition that will change both of their lives forever. BEARTOOTH is a fast-paced tale with moments of surprising poignancy set in the grandeur of the American West. Evoking the timeless voices of American pastoral storytelling, this is a bracing, masterful novel about survival, revenge and the bond between brothers."

By all accounts, Carl and Roy Opgard are doing quite well for themselves. Or at least they\u2019re doing as well as can be expected in a small town like Os. Carl manages the area\u2019s swanky and successful spa and hotel, while Roy runs a nearby gas station and harbors grand plans to build it out into an entire amusement park, complete with a roller coaster. But when news breaks about a new highway to be built nearby, bypassing Os and leaving the town cutoff and isolated, it\u2019s clear that something has to be done\u2026even if the methods are bound to be dirty. Fortunately, Carl and Roy have experience with just that kind of work. Meanwhile, the town sheriff has gotten his hands on new technology that will enable him to take a deeper look at a slate of unsolved murders from years past --- including that of his own father. And just as the sheriff reopens his investigation, the death toll begins to climb. It\u2019s like Roy says about his roller coaster: \u201cOnce it\u2019s rolling, it\u2019s too late to get off.\u201d BLOOD TIES is a tense, compulsively readable tour de force about loyalty, family ties and love that is as destructive as it is powerful."

Prudence Wright seems to have it all: a loving husband, Davis; a spacious home in Washington, D.C.; and the former glories of a successful career at McKinsey, which now enables her to dedicate her days to her autistic son, Roland. When she and Davis head out for dinner with one of Davis\u2019 new colleagues on a stormy summer evening filled with startling and unwelcome interruptions, Prudence has little reason to think that certain details of her history might arise sometime between cocktails and the appetizer course. Yet when Davis\u2019 colleague turns out to be Matshediso, a man from Prudence\u2019s past, she is transported back to the formative months she spent as a law student in South Africa in 1996. As an intern at a Johannesburg law firm, Prudence attended sessions of the Truth and Reconciliation hearings that uncovered the many horrors and human rights abuses of the Apartheid state, and which fundamentally shaped her sense of righteousness and justice. Prudence experienced personal horrors in South Africa as well, long hidden and now at risk of coming to light. When Matshediso finally reveals the real reason behind his sudden reappearance, he will force Prudence to examine her most deeply held beliefs and excavate inner reserves of resilience and strength. Lauren Francis-Sharma\u2019s previous two novels have established her as a deft chronicler of history and its intersections with flawed humans struggling to find peace in unjust circumstances. With keen insight and gripping tension, CASUALTIES OF TRUTH explosively mines questions of whether we are ever truly able to remove the stains of our past and how we may attempt to reconcile with unquestionable wrongs."

Lingering at the edge of a family party, a troop of cousins loses track of the youngest child among them. With their parents preoccupied with bickering about decades-old crises, the children decide they must set out to investigate themselves --- to the rickety chicken coop, the barn and its two troublesome horses, and into the woods that once comprised their late grandmother\u2019s property. The more the children search, and the deeper they walk, the more threatening the woods become and the more lost they are, caught between their aunt\u2019s home in the present day, their parents\u2019 childhood home just through the trees and the memory of the house their grandmother grew up in. Soon, what began as a quest for answers gives way to a journey that undermines everything they\u2019ve been told about who they are, where they came from and what they deserve. Disquieting and delightful, IDLE GROUNDS is a rich exploration of the interior lives of children and a gripping meditation on birthright, decline and weight of family history. A fable of the distortions of privilege and the impossibility of keeping secrets hidden, this is a novel about straying from home --- only to come back unraveled, unsettled and irrevocably changed."

Perfect for readers of Brit Bennett and Tayari Jones. Two women. Two pivotal moments. One dream for justice and equality. In the fall of 1959, Freda Gilroy arrives on the campus of Fisk University full of hope, carrying a suitcase and the voice of her father telling her she\u2019s part of a family legacy of greatness. Soon, the ugliness of the Jim Crow South intrudes, and she\u2019s thrust into a movement for social change. Freda is reluctant to get involved, torn between a soon-to-be doctor her parents approve of and an audacious young man willing to risk it all in the name of justice. Freda finds herself caught between two worlds, and two loves, and must decide how much she\u2019s willing to sacrifice for the advancement of her people. In 1992 Chicago, Freda\u2019s daughter, Tulip, is an ambitious PR professional on track for an exciting career, if workplace politics and racial microaggressions don\u2019t get in her way. But with the ruling in the Rodney King trial weighing heavily on her, Tulip feels called to action. When she makes an irreversible professional misstep as she seeks to uplift her community, she must decide, just like her mother had three decades prior, what she\u2019s willing to risk in the name of justice and equality. Insightful, evocative and richly imagined with stories of hidden history, PEOPLE OF MEANS is an emotional tour de force that offers a glimpse into the quest for racial equality, the pursuit of personal and communal success, and the power of love and family ties."

The five greatest women crime writers have banded together to form a secret society with a single goal: to show they are no longer willing to be treated as second-class citizens by their male counterparts in the legendary Detection Club. Led by the formidable Dorothy L. Sayers, the group includes Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham and Baroness Emma Orczy. They call themselves the Queens of Crime. Their plan? Solve an actual murder, that of a young woman found strangled in a park in France who may have connections leading to the highest levels of the British establishment. May Daniels, a young English nurse on an excursion to France with her friend, seemed to vanish into thin air as they prepared to board a ferry home. Months later, her body is found in the nearby woods. The murder has all the hallmarks of a locked room mystery for which these authors are famous. How did her killer manage to sneak her body out of a crowded train station without anyone noticing? If, as the police believe, the cause of death is manual strangulation, why is there is an extraordinary amount of blood at the crime scene? What is the meaning of a heartbreaking secret letter seeming to implicate an unnamed paramour? Determined to solve the highly publicized murder, the Queens of Crime embark on their own investigation, discovering they\u2019re stronger together. But soon the killer targets Dorothy Sayers herself, threatening to expose a dark secret in her past that she would do anything to keep hidden. Inspired by a true story in Sayers\u2019 own life, New York Times bestselling author Marie Benedict brings to life the lengths to which five talented women writers will go to be taken seriously in the male-dominated world of letters as they unpuzzle a mystery torn from the pages of their own novels."

All the while, enemies close upon her flanks, and a greater danger lurks ahead. For beneath a desert turned to glass, hidden from the scorching heat, life thrives --- both wondrous and monstrous. But a more fearsome menace lies even deeper, where an ancient army has been seeded to protect a secret from any who dare seek it out. Yet, can Nyx truly trust those at her side? Or even herself? For while her gifts grow ever stronger, so does the danger of losing herself to a dark madness. Worst yet, the same afflicts Bashaliia, her winged and bonded brother. Elsewhere, a looming war explodes across the Crown, forging new alliances and greater enmities, as lands around the globe are drawn into fiery conflict. Prince Kanthe --- now consort to the newly crowned Empress of the Southern Klashe --- recognizes a hard truth: to save the world, he must destroy all that he once loved. Beyond such struggles, a new cunning peril smolders at the heart of a kingdom. Hidden in the Shrivenkeep of the Iflelen, an ancient bronze weapon has been awoken. Fed by blood, fueled by hatred, it has only one purpose: to end all life on Urth. But in this goal, will Nyx prove to be its ally or foe?"

All Hamish Macbeth ever really wants is a quiet life in the peaceful surroundings of his home in the Highland village of Lochdubh. Unfortunately for him, the time he would normally find most relaxing, after the tourists have gone and before the winter sets in, turns out to be far from peaceful. The new love in his life, Claire, is keen for them to take a holiday and Hamish is mulling over the idea when his newly-assigned constable arrives, presenting Hamish with both a surprise and a secret. Getting to the bottom of the secret becomes the least of Hamish\u2019s problems when, at the opening of the revamped village pub, he meets a family who has a score to settle with a sinister man who has mysteriously gone missing. Discovering a murdered woman\u2019s body puts further pressure on Hamish, especially when it becomes clear that the murdered woman and the missing man were linked, although their true identities become yet another mystery. To Hamish\u2019s horror, he then finds himself working on the murder case with the despicable Detective Chief Inspector Blair, his sworn enemy, who has been drafted in under curious circumstances. With a growing list of suspects, ever more bewildering circumstances and Blair hindering him at every turn, Hamish must find the murderer before anyone else falls victim. Never has a quiet life seemed further from his grasp!"

        "review": " From rare book dealer and guest star of the hit show \"Pawn Stars,\" a page-turning literary adventure that introduces readers to the women writers who inspired Jane Austen --- and investigates why their books have disappeared from our shelves. Long before she was a rare book dealer, Rebecca Romney was a devoted reader of Jane Austen. She loved that Austen\u2019s books took the lives of women seriously, explored relationships with wit and confidence and always allowed for the possibility of a happy ending. She read and reread them, often wishing Austen wrote just one more. But Austen wasn\u2019t a lone genius. She wrote at a time of great experimentation for women writers --- and clues about those women, and the exceptional books they wrote, are sprinkled like breadcrumbs throughout Austen\u2019s work. Every character in NORTHANGER ABBEY who isn\u2019t a boor sings the praises of Ann Radcliffe. The play that causes such a stir in MANSFIELD PARK is a real one by the playwright Elizabeth Inchbald. In fact, the phrase \u201cpride and prejudice\u201d came from Frances Burney\u2019s second novel, CECILIA. The women who populated Jane Austen\u2019s bookshelf profoundly influenced her work; Austen looked up to them, passionately discussed their books with her friends and used an appreciation of their books as a litmus test for whether someone had good taste. So where had these women gone? Why hadn\u2019t Romney --- despite her training --- ever read them? Or, in some cases, even heard of them? And why were they no longer embraced as part of the wider literary canon? JANE AUSTEN'S BOOKSHELF investigates the disappearance of Austen\u2019s heroes --- women writers who were erased from the Western canon --- to reveal who they were, what they meant to Austen and how they were forgotten. Each chapter profiles a different writer including Frances Burney, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Lennox, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, Elizabeth Inchbald, Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi and Maria Edgeworth --- and recounts Romney\u2019s experience reading them, finding rare copies of their works and drawing on connections between their words and Austen\u2019s. Romney collects the once-famed works of these forgotten writers, physically recreating Austen\u2019s bookshelf and making a convincing case for why these books should be placed back on the to-be-read pile of all book lovers today. JANE AUSTEN'S BOOKSHELF will encourage you to look beyond assigned reading lists, question who decides what belongs there, and build your very own collection of favorite novels."

Once a master spy for Russian foreign intelligence, then the partner and lover of the Gray Man, she has information the Kremlin wants and they don't care what they have to do to get it. But if they think a thousand miles of frozen wasteland and the combined power of the Russian police state is enough to protect them, they don't know the Gray Man. He's coming, and no one's safe."
