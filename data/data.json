        "review": " Nickolas Butler, the critically acclaimed author of SHOTGUN LOVESONGS, returns with A FORTY YEAR KISS, a beautiful, life-affirming novel about second chances and sunset triumph. Featuring a sixty-something couple giving love another try as they revisit their youth, the book will appeal to any reader in need of a love story for the ages. When we meet Charlie, he is 64 years old and nursing a beer in a bar as he waits for his date to arrive. It\u2019s not exactly the future he had planned. Married at 20 and two more times since then, Charlie never expected to be having butterflies as he waits for a love match to find him. But even more surprising than being single at 60 is the identity of his date: his ex-wife, Vivian. Married for four years in their early 20s, Charlie and Vivian divorced for a number of reasons, but all of them come back to one: Charlie\u2019s drinking, a bad habit with which he continues to struggle. But unlike the Charlie of 40 years ago, this Charlie at least knows he has a problem. He\u2019s determined to bury it once and for all so that he can love Vivian the way he was meant to: totally, completely and endlessly. It\u2019s a real \u201cwish upon a star\u201d kind of dream, but he is ready to do whatever it takes to earn her trust again, even if it means laying all of his cards on the table. \"This truly is a literary valentine that will appeal to readers from all walks of life and ages.... Perfect for book clubs, A FORTY YEAR KISS is dazzling in its lyricism and poignant in its takeaways.\" Of course, 40 years isn\u2019t a small amount of time, and while Charlie has been busy getting married and divorced and nursing his heartbreaks with alcohol, Vivian has also moved on. Married only one more time after Charlie, Vivian is now the single mother of Jessie and Melissa, and grandmother to Melissa\u2019s two girls, Ainsley and Addison. Jessie lives in a group home, so Vivian resides with Melissa and her daughters, fully immersing herself in all the pleasures and delights of grandmotherhood. Looking back, Vivian wouldn\u2019t change the trajectory of her life for anything --- not when she has two beloved, adorable granddaughters to show for it --- but even she can admit that she hasn\u2019t always been happy and her current life can sometimes feel a bit smothering. Simply put, it has been a long time since anyone really treasured or was simply nice to her. So when she receives a message from her ex-husband, she doesn\u2019t think twice. What\u2019s wrong with grabbing a drink with an old friend? Charlie is quick to admit the real reason he returned to their small town after a near lifetime of working on trains: he is in love with Vivian and wants them to try to make it work again. Vivian is touched, even flattered by Charlie\u2019s zeal, and she can\u2019t deny that he certainly seems different: more focused and responsible, and less reactionary. But she also can\u2019t ignore the fact that she\u2019s grown very accustomed to her independence. Where she once cowered from her husband\u2019s outbursts, she is now much more comfortable having outbursts of her own, standing up for herself, and maintaining the boundaries she has so carefully built up after a lifetime of hurt. Rather than being turned off by this new, more confident Vivian, Charlie is entranced. This, he thinks, is the Vivian he always loved, the one he knew was hiding behind her unflappable exterior as he drank their life and love story away. With Charlie and Vivian committed to at least trying again, a few painful truths come to the forefront. First, Vivian has been hiding a secret from Charlie for 40 years, one that could not only threaten their reunion, but change his life forever. Second, falling in love and agreeing to marry when you\u2019re young is one thing --- naivety comes with blinders, after all --- but doing the same thing at 60 is unbelievable, radical even. Both are set in their ways and routines, and blending their lives --- and those of Vivian\u2019s daughters and granddaughters --- comes with much higher stakes than it did when they were just two dumb kids in love. Add to that Charlie\u2019s alcoholism, and you have not just a love story, but a love battle, the ultimate fight for true love in all its iterations. With Charlie and Vivian confronting their pasts --- both shared and individual --- it will take many painful discussions, a lot of uncomfortable truths, and some serious reckoning with redemption for them to usher in and revive their love. Fortunately, with Nickolas Butler at the writing helm, A FORTY YEAR KISS does just that. This truly is a literary valentine that will appeal to readers from all walks of life and ages. Although it\u2019s a tender and compassionate tale, Butler is never overly sentimental or mawkish, choosing instead to let his characters\u2019 burdens and backstories ground the otherwise romantic plot and give it some real literary heft and muscle. Far from diluting the love story, this choice actually helps the romance between Charlie and Vivian come to life, almost turning it into a third character, the underdog who you really root for. Although Charlie and Vivian are the stars of this life-affirming tale, I was equally if not more charmed by Melissa and her interactions with Charlie. Despite the fact that Charlie has never fathered children or created a real family, his ability to adapt to and even rescue Vivian\u2019s daughter from herself is proof of his total redemption. It makes Vivian\u2019s love for him --- despite his flaws --- gritty and real, but also soaring and romantic. Perfect for book clubs, A FORTY YEAR KISS is dazzling in its lyricism and poignant in its takeaways. Reviewed by Rebecca Munro on February 7, 2025"

        "review": " A LONG TIME GONE is perhaps the most personal story in Joshua Moehling\u2019s series starring Deputy Ben Packard, who already made a splash as an openly gay lead character. This time, it is not his sexuality that takes center stage, but his family\u2019s haunted past. After losing the local sheriff\u2019s race, Packard is currently dealing with the harsh reality that he now has to report to his hated rival as he is demoted to the position of bag check scanner at the courthouse. Trouble always seems to find Packard, and his latest assignment is no exception. He is on duty when one of the parties in a heated case presents a weapon, and he is forced to fire, killing Robert Clark before he can get off a third shot. Now on administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated, Packard is thrust back into his past and must deal with wounds that have never healed. \"Joshua Moehling is now officially a force to be reckoned with, and A LONG TIME GONE continues one of the best written mystery/thriller series on the market.\" When he was just a boy, Packard\u2019s older brother, Nick, walked out the back door of their family home never to be seen or heard from again. He had been declared dead decades ago, but Packard and his loved ones never recovered from the incident and experienced no closure. Suddenly new information arises that may indicate the location of Nick\u2019s body. This brings Packard\u2019s estranged mother back into town. They are both surprised to find that the woman who purchased their old home recently died in a household accident when she was found on the floor with a broken neck. The death appeared to be suspicious, and suddenly Packard finds himself rooted in two separate but possibly related tragedies. Something as innocent as a photograph of Nick swimming in a nearby lake with two old friends sets Packard off on a hunt for answers. However, everyone he encounters who may have been around Nick the summer he disappeared comes across as untrustworthy and unnecessarily elusive. As frustrating as this is, he is not swayed in his efforts to learn the truth, and the novel\u2019s pace really picks up when he delves deeper into his past. The relationship between Packard and his mother is both stereotypical and comical, providing for some welcome lighthearted moments amidst all of the darkness that the narrative brings.

AND MRS. DOCTOR. When 276 schoolgirls are abducted from their school in Nigeria, Fidelis Ewerike, a Florida-based barrister, poet and former POW of the Nigerian Civil War, begins to go mad, consumed by memories of his younger sister, Ugochi, who went missing during that conflict. Consumed by survivor\u2019s guilt and fearful that the same fate awaits Amara, his 16-year-old daughter who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ugochi, Fidelis locks her in her bedroom, offering no words of explanation, only lovingly --- if poorly --- made meals and sweets. Amid that singular action, the Ewerike family spirals into chaos. After unsuccessful attempts to free her daughter from her room, his wife, Adaobi, seeks the counsel of a preacher, praying for spiritual liberation from the curse she is certain has plagued her family since leaving Nigeria. Fourteen-year-old Chuk, beset by his own war with the neighborhood boys, receives a painful education on force, masculinity, and his tenuous position within his family. And rebellious, resentful Amara is hungry for her life to be hers, so the moment she is able to escape her imprisonment, she falls in love --- not with the Aba-born engineer-in-training her mother envisages, but with Maksym Kostyk, the son of the town drunk. Before long, the two have concocted a plan to run away from the trappings of their familial traumas. Perfect for readers of SING, UNBURIED, SING, Julie Iromuanya's A SEASON OF LIGHT is an all-consuming masterpiece. To peer into the window of the Ewerike family\u2019s lives is a gift."

Professional baseball has featured a bevy of superstars over the past century and a half, but only a few of them have impacted their sport and cities as deeply as Willie McCovey and Billy Williams. Born just a handful of miles apart in 1938, they grew up in and around one of the sport\u2019s true cradles, Mobile, Alabama, on their way to producing two iconic careers in Major League Baseball. In A TIME FOR REFLECTION, Jason Cannon examines these two legends of the game. Overcoming the heinous racism of the Jim Crow South as part of the second generation of African American major leaguers who followed in the footsteps of Jackie Robinson, they became two of baseball\u2019s all-time greatest players. Off the field, they took impactful stands for racial progress that continue to resonate today. Their personal resolve, leadership in the clubhouse and dedication to their baseball communities endeared them to teammates and fans alike. Featuring original interviews with family members, friends, teammates and Williams himself, A TIME FOR REFLECTION brings to life their monumental accomplishments on the diamond, while also detailing how McCovey and Williams grew into pillars of San Francisco and Chicago and inspired future generations of ballplayers."

        "review": " In much the same way that writers and would-be writers are drawn to well-written accounts of other writers' processes and philosophies, as a voracious lifelong reader I've always been fascinated by the attempts of others to understand how and why we read. I'm not talking about the science of how we acquire the ability to read --- though that also is an interesting topic --- but rather the intellectual pursuit of what draws us to read for pleasure, knowledge or connection, and how what we read shapes who we are. For that reason, despite or perhaps because of its provocative title, I was immediately drawn to BIBLIOPHOBIA. Best known as a literary critic and co-author of THE FERRANTE LETTERS, Sarah Chihaya opens her unusual memoir with a chapter also entitled \"Bibliophobia\" that explains the origins of the book's title. Here she begins to describe (though the most harrowing details are revealed later on) the mental breakdown that resulted in her hospitalization. As she explains, this breakdown always felt inevitable to her: \"It wasn't a surprise that I ended up in the hospital. The main surprise was how long it took me to get there.\" \"Some sections of BIBLIOPHOBIA come as close as anything I've read to describing some of the phenomenon of losing oneself in a book... BIBLIOPHOBIA is rich, complex and rewarding, as the very best reading should be.\" So for Chihaya, the most troubling aspect of her breakdown was not that it happened at all, but that it was accompanied by a truly disturbing side effect: she became profoundly disinterested in reading. \"Reading was my whole life, whether I liked it or not: My work life and my home life were built around reading, my physical space constructed by walls of books. All of them were useless to me now, and, looking at them, I felt nauseous.\" The balance of that opening chapter begins to trace the roots of her acute bibliophobia and also follows her as she finds, with the help of her friend and a particularly forceful book recommendation, her way out of it. Subsequent chapters delve into Chihaya's personal history as it intersects with specific books. This sounds like a rather superficial or simplistic way to structure a novel, but I assure you that this surface description is not doing the memoir justice. In these sections, she touches not only on the books themselves and where she was in her life when she first encountered them, but also on a multitude of other topics that --- much like the process of being a lifelong reader --- spiral out from this center in intricate and intriguing ways. In a chapter on L.M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series, for example, Chihaya reflects not only on her own youthful reading habits but also on her country of origin (Canada) and her cultural heritage (Japanese). She ruminates about tidy narratives and if the stories we tell about ourselves are as carefully crafted as the novels we read. In addition, she reveals her early suicide attempts and reflects on Montgomery's own likely suicide. Some sections of BIBLIOPHOBIA come as close as anything I've read to describing some of the phenomenon of losing oneself in a book, and what that phrase even means when you think about it seriously: \"I didn't go to books to be a heroine. I went to books because I wanted to be --- nothing, nobody. I wanted nothing so much as to be a kind of sociable air, circulating invisibly in the room, necessary but never noticed.\" In most cases, later chapters focus largely on individual books (such as A.S. Byatt's POSSESSION or Toni Morrison's THE BLUEST EYE). But each carefully wrought chapter also introduces a host of other references and considerations, not to mention insights into Chihaya's own story, finally circling back to the events leading up to that breakdown. Inveterate readers will appreciate that Chihaya opens the volume with a comprehensive list of all the books considered within. Initially, the memoir can read like a series of personal essays on a common theme, but these chapters do gradually build on one another, as Chihaya's story becomes the narrative of her lifelong quest to find the book that will save her --- and her realization of the impossibility of that pursuit. BIBLIOPHOBIA is rich, complex and rewarding, as the very best reading should be. Reviewed by Norah Piehl on February 7, 2025"

So she\u2019s a little hungover, sometimes, and she has to bring her daughter, Emaleen, to her job waiting tables at an Alaskan roadside lodge, but she\u2019s getting by as a single mother in a tough town. Still, Birdie can remember happier times from her youth, when she was free in the wilds of nature. Arthur Neilsen, a soft-spoken and scarred recluse who appears in town only at the change of seasons, brings Emaleen back to safety when she gets lost in the woods. Most people avoid him, but to Birdie, he represents everything she\u2019s ever longed for. She finds herself falling for Arthur and the land he knows so well. Against the warnings of those who care about them, Birdie and Emaleen move to his isolated cabin in the mountains, on the far side of the Wolverine River. It\u2019s just the three of them in the vast black woods, far from roads, telephones, electricity and outside contact, but Birdie believes she has come prepared. At first, it\u2019s idyllic and she can picture a happily ever after: Together they catch salmon, pick berries, and climb mountains so tall it\u2019s as if they could touch the bright blue sky. But soon Birdie discovers that Arthur is something much more mysterious and dangerous than she ever could have imagined and that like the Alaska wilderness, a fairy tale can be as dark as it is beautiful. BLACK WOODS, BLUE SKY is a novel with life-and-death stakes, about the love between a mother and daughter, and the allure of a wild life --- about what we gain and what it might cost us."

Responding to an urgent summons from an old compatriot, he landed in New York and eased into the waiting car. And died within minutes. Lieutenant Eve Dallas finds the Rossi case frustrating. She has an elderly victim who just arrived from Rome; a widow who knows nothing about why he left; an as-yet unidentifiable weapon and zero results on facial recognition. But when she finds a connection to the Urban Wars of the 2020s, she thinks Summerset --- fiercely loyal, if somewhat grouchy, majordomo and the man who rescued her husband from the Dublin streets --- may know something from his stint as a medic in Europe back then. When Summerset learns of the crime, his shock and grief are clear --- because, as he eventually reveals, he himself was one of The Twelve. It\u2019s not a part of his past he likes to revisit. But now he must --- not only to assist Eve\u2019s investigation, but because a cryptic message from the killer has boasted that others of The Twelve have also died.

SHE'S NOT THERE was the first bestselling work written by a transgender American. Since its publication 20 years ago, Jennifer Finney Boylan has become the go-to person for insight into the impact of gender on our lives --- from the food we eat to the dreams we dream, both for ourselves and for our children. But CLEAVAGE is more than a deep dive into gender identity; it\u2019s also a look at the difference between coming out as trans in 2000 --- when many people reacted to Boylan\u2019s transition with love --- and the present era of blowback and fear. How does gender affect our sense of self? Our body image? The passage of time? The friends we lose --- and keep? Boylan considers her womanhood, reflects on the boys and men who shaped her, and reconceives of herself as a writer, activist, parent and spouse. With heart-wrenching honesty, she illustrates the feeling of liminality that followed her to adulthood, but demonstrates the redemptive power of love through it all. With Boylan\u2019s trademark humor and poignancy, CLEAVAGE is a sharp, witty and captivating look at the triumphs and losses of a life lived in two genders. It provides hope for a future in which we all have the freedom to live joyfully as men, as women and in the space between us."

It is a story of woman vs. nature that will have readers riveted until the very last page. \"ISOLA is a stunning achievement that rivals Alexandre Dumas' and Victor Hugo's classic tales of adventure, survival and political intrigue.\" The heroine is Marguerite, heir to a chateau with its own village and properties. She is a child taken under the wing and supposed protection of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Rocque de Roberval, a volatile man who takes control of her life. He sells her land to pay his own debts and leaves her without a penny, then forces her to go with him on an expedition to New France.

She deftly captures the frailty and desires of this young woman, as well as the full range of searching questions facing her amidst this danger and despair. Why is she being treated this way? What forces have led her to this moment of supreme abandonment? Is the God she was taught to love and fear looking out for her, or is this just another lie she was taught as a gullible child? Perhaps the best part of this adventure is how Marguerite learns to trust herself, to discover strengths she didn\u2019t know she had, and, above all, to show that she is a resilient and creative being who can fight against the best of what the world decides to throw at her. ISOLA is a magical and mesmerizing journey into one woman\u2019s soul and how she flowers under the most horrific circumstances. In our world of reality TV shows like \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cNaked and Afraid,\u201d the exploits of men and women who wish to push themselves against the terrific power of the natural world are on full display. However, these adventurers take on this journey with full acceptance, unlike Marguerite. It is not lost on Goodman\u2019s audience that the terms by which Marguerite must act are not exactly fair and represent the most difficult and horrific terms in which any human can find himself or herself. With our extensive knowledge of how the natural world interacts with our own world, readers will connect most soundly to this incredible tale and the consequences that Marguerite faces. Goodman adds in a good dose of girl power for modern audiences, as well as a heavy helping of romance among the danger and derring-do. ISOLA is a story for the ages. In these days of a constantly changing world, the emotional and deliberate intensity of this story can offer all of us a balm. As Marguerite builds a life with her own two hands, readers will find inspiration and exaltation in Allegra Goodman\u2019s poetic tale of human survival.

When Kate Gies was four years old, a plastic surgeon pressed a synthetic ear to the right side of her head and pulled out a mirror. He told her he could make her \u201cwhole\u201d --- could make her \u201cright\u201d --- and she believed him. From the ages of 4 to 13, she underwent 14 surgeries, including skin and bone grafts, to craft the appearance of an outer ear. Many of the surgeries failed, leaving permanent damage to her body. In short, lyrical vignettes, Kate writes about how her \u201cdisfigured\u201d body was scrutinized, pathologized and even weaponized. She describes the physical and psychic trauma of medical intervention and its effects on her sense of self, first as a child needing to be fixed and, later, as a teenager and adult navigating the complex expectations and dangers of being a woman. IT MUST BE BEAUTIFUL TO BE FINISHED is the story of a girl desperately trying to have a body that makes her acceptable and of a woman learning to own a body she has never felt was hers to define. In an age of speaking out about the abuse of marginalized bodies, this memoir takes a hard look at the role of the medical system in body oppression and trauma."

        "review": " Fans of Pam Jenoff know that her historical novels don't just tell a story. They insert us right into the middle of shocking events most of us have never heard of that deserve to be exposed. The French capitulated to the Germans during WWII, and many didn't seem particularly opposed to assisting when it came to the impoundment of the Jewish French population. The French police joined in with the Gestapo to help round up the Jews of Paris, and many of the French population were only too happy to take for their own apartments that had belonged to Parisian Jews. Jenoff shares a little-known facet of that war in LAST TWILIGHT IN PARIS, a fictional account that takes place partly in L\u00e9vitan, the French furniture store that served as both a Jewish detention center and a shopping mecca for Nazi officers during the war. \"One of Jenoff's strengths as an author is her unerring ability to find obscure events that happened during WWII and tell them through the voices of fictional people she brings to life.... In LAST TWILIGHT IN PARIS, she has some truly clever twists in store for us as we try to reconcile the events in all the timelines.\" Jewish prisoners were housed in the store and forced to sort and polish the stolen belongings of the Jewish people whom the Germans sent to concentration camps. The story is told through the eyes of Helaine, a young Jewish woman who lives in Paris with her wealthy parents at the start of the novel, and Louise, who is from London and had volunteered for the Red Cross during the war. What connects these two ladies is a gold necklace called a mizpah, which Louise finds in 1953, at the bottom of a box of mostly rubbish that she sorts through at the local charity thrift shop. When she sees it, Louise is taken back to her time in the war, when she saw it in the hands of her friend, Franny. Jenoff is a master at doling out just a bit of information at a time so that we remain engrossed in the story and can't wait to uncover all the truths. We know that the necklace is important to Louise and that she feels some guilt related to it, but we don't know why. Franny\u2019s death has haunted Louise. When she discovers the necklace, which she is convinced is the same one because of a chip on the top, she is determined to find out what really happened and why Franny died. Jenoff unfolds the story through Louise's first person narrative and Helaine's story, which is told in third person. At first, the different time lines are a bit confusing. But Jenoff repeats the pattern of a chapter with Helaine's narrative beginning in 1938 and moving forward chronologically, and another chapter with Louise's narrative beginning in \"present\" day 1953, and then traveling back to 1944 to recount Louise's activities then. It's difficult to envision how Jenoff will pull it all together and what Louise will find out about the necklace and its missing half. This was in a time before computers and the internet. All records were paper, and many were destroyed by the Germans at the end of the war. One of Jenoff's strengths as an author is her unerring ability to find obscure events that happened during WWII and tell them through the voices of fictional people she brings to life. In doing so, she shines a light not only on little-known atrocities, but also on small, inspiring acts of courage. While on one level we know that the characters are not real, we can't stop reading as we are truly invested in seeing how their stories play out. And Jenoff is a magnificent storyteller. In LAST TWILIGHT IN PARIS, she has some truly clever twists in store for us as we try to reconcile the events in all the timelines. Perhaps now, more than ever, it's important to read and share books that demonstrate the evil of unchecked power and the dangers in demonizing \"the other.\" Reading about Louise and Helaine, two ordinary women who might have been separated by the English Channel, religion and their war experiences, but also were connected by their human emotions, we observe their love for their family and their struggle to make sense of a world gone crazy.

        "review": " On May 27, 2019 --- Memorial Day --- Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and historian Tony Horwitz collapsed and died on a Washington, DC sidewalk, less than two weeks before his 61st birthday. In her spare, beautiful memoir, MEMORIAL DAYS, his widow --- bestselling novelist and Pulitzer Prize winner Geraldine Brooks --- offers both a frank and moving portrait of her grief and a touching tribute to her late husband and the life they shared for more than three decades. Brooks received the news of Horwitz\u2019s death in an abrupt phone call from a resident at George Washington University Medical Center while alone at the home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard that they had shared since 2005. Their elder son, Nathaniel, was on a plane to Australia with his girlfriend, completing a post-college trip before starting his first job in Boston. Their younger son, Bizu, adopted at age five from Ethiopia and now a high school sophomore, was at his boarding school. As she raced to catch the plane in Boston that would take her to her brother-in-law\u2019s home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, Brooks describes the fog of bewilderment in which she lived as she struggled to process the reality that her husband \u201cwith the toned body of a six-day-a-week gym rat\u201d could be gone. \u201cHe\u2019s way too busy living,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe cannot possibly be dead.\u201d Her every attempt to comprehend the incomprehensible falls short. \"Most people will find it easy to read MEMORIAL DAYS in a single sitting. The hard-earned lessons it imparts are ones that will endure for a lifetime.\" When he died, Horwitz indeed was busy living and working. He was nearing the end of an exhausting book tour to promote SPYING ON THE SOUTH, a work he produced while adhering to a punishing regimen that saw him consuming Nicorette gum by the box, nibbling the stimulant Provigil, and washing that down with pints of coffee, chasing those hours of concentrated effort with an intense workout at the gym. To bring himself down at night, Horwitz consumed large quantities of wine that had his cardiologist expressing concern about his drinking. When he reported a pair of episodes of shortness of breath during exercise, it was enough for the doctor to schedule a battery of tests. Sadly, that intervention came too late. Alternating with terse sections that describe the aftermath of Horwitz\u2019s death, ending with the autopsy result that reveals its cause, and then the interment of his ashes in August 2019, is the story of what Brooks calls her own \u201cmemorial days\u201d --- the several weeks she spent in February 2023 on tiny, remote Flinders Island, located off the northeast coast of Tasmania. The island, once part of a land bridge that connected Tasmania to Australia, Brooks\u2019 homeland, is home to barely a thousand people. Over the course of her visit, she resides alone in two different tiny shacks, the first of which is so spartan it lacks indoor plumbing. Nearly four years after Horwitz\u2019s passing, Brooks recognizes that she\u2019s never taken the time to properly mourn her loss, and this extended interlude is her attempt to compensate for the absence of an adequate expression of her grief. Fresh from a book tour for HORSE, she confesses to erecting \u201ca facade that I have hidden behind, a fugitive from my own feelings.\u201d She purposefully had dammed up a necessary flood of tears, admitting her fear \u201cthat if I started, I mightn\u2019t be able to stop,\u201d but now she is determined to \u201clet sadness come and accept it.\u201d Brooks wanders the gorgeous island, nourished by striking topography that features a \u201cjuxtaposition of earth and water even more marvelous than Big Sur,\u201d as she takes in its alluring flora and exotic nocturnal wildlife --- wallabies, pademelons and wombats. She spends hours paging through Horwitz\u2019s journals dating back to their days as graduate students at Columbia Journalism School, where they met in 1983, and reflecting on their illustrious professional careers, conjoined for a time when they both worked as correspondents for the Wall Street Journal and shared a prize for their coverage of the first Iraq War. Inevitably, Brooks feels \u201cfurious with death,\u201d cheated out of what she\u2019d always envisioned as many years of shared experience and accomplishment. Her emotions are a reminder that no days are promised to any of us, and time together can\u2019t be taken for granted at any age. But by the end of her sojourn, her solitary time in nature has brought her a measure of peace. Despite her book\u2019s brevity, Brooks makes space for both informative and highly practical material. She describes the memorial customs of various traditions, including the Judaism she converted to when she married Horwitz in 1984, and the one known as \u201cSorry Business\u201d among Australia\u2019s First Nations People, as well as revealing the tragic persecution of the native people on Flinders Island in the 1830s. Along with navigating some of the difficulties of the Massachusetts probate system, she recounts the terror of finding out that the family\u2019s health insurance had been cancelled to illustrate the pitfalls of a marital division of labor. In their case, domestic chores fell to her, while Horwitz managed family finances. In the absence of meaningful overlap, she suggests that each spouse create a \u201cYour Life: How It Works\u201d document to make it easier for the survivor to navigate a solo future. Brooks mentions Joan Didion\u2019s THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING in passing, and the parallels between her experience and Didion\u2019s are inescapable. But as she makes clear, every experience of grief is singular, and when it\u2019s described with the emotional intelligence and eloquence of a writer like Brooks, it\u2019s well worth adding to the sizable pile of books on this universal subject. Most people will find it easy to read MEMORIAL DAYS in a single sitting. The hard-earned lessons it imparts are ones that will endure for a lifetime.

        "review": " There\u2019s a reason why studios release movies that they think have a good chance at the Oscars late in the year. Memories are short, and sometimes a film that comes out in February is forgotten by December. Unfortunately, the same phenomenon can happen with books. But I\u2019m making a note now not to forget about MUTUAL INTEREST when it comes time to compile \u201cbest books\u201d lists at the end of the year. I\u2019ve been anticipating this book for a while. Memories may be short, but Olivia Wolfgang-Smith\u2019s debut, GLASSWORKS, was one of my favorites when it came out in 2023. That novel --- which traced a history of glass through multiple generations of a family --- was in some ways more structurally complex than MUTUAL INTEREST. But her sophomore effort is no less satisfying as its storytelling is just as compelling. The first section introduces readers to its primary characters. They don\u2019t know each other then, but we meet them when they are still children or teenagers. \"MUTUAL INTEREST brilliantly explores the freedom that wealth affords its queer characters --- and the limitations that even wealth can\u2019t overcome.\" In 1898, Vivian Lesperance is a rambunctious rebel who is desperate to escape Utica and her parents\u2019 meanness and poverty. She is equally desperate to avoid marriage to a man, which her parents posit as her only way out, and begins to recognize her attraction to other girls. Oscar Schmidt, who is 20 years older than Vivian, grows up in central Ohio, confused and embarrassed by his attraction to other boys and (much like Vivian) desperate to escape to a place where his sexual orientation is less likely to mark him as strange. He finds freedom --- and a career in the soap-making business --- in New York City. Squire Clancy is a native New Yorker, raised in a loveless but fabulously wealthy household. As a child, his peculiarities are not around sexual orientation but his tendency to become transfixed by the strangest topics, from dinosaur fossils to sewer systems. As a young man, he becomes obsessed with the notion (outlandish at the time) of making scented candles. His path first crosses Oscar\u2019s after he corners the market on scented plants in order to conduct his experiments, stymying Oscar\u2019s soap-making business. Oscar and Vivian --- who connected at a couple of parties and saw in one another kindred spirits of a sort --- have already established something of a marriage of convenience by the time Squire enters their lives. Soon what began as a professional rivalry develops into something very different, as the three of them enter into business --- and unconventional personal and professional relationships that serve each of them very well indeed. As I mentioned, MUTUAL INTEREST is a fairly straightforward historical novel. It unfolds more or less chronologically, with storytelling that in some ways feels almost old-fashioned. But it\u2019s also a thoroughly contemporary novel, inasmuch as it seeks to place fascinating, even inspiring, queer stories into the conventional Gilded Age narratives of wealth and power. Vivian is a thoroughly fascinating character. Finding herself on the margins of New York society, she learns through observation and her own shrewdness how to manipulate that society to her own ends, and she\u2019s fabulously successful at doing so. But even as she utilizes her relationship with Oscar and Squire (and their romantic relationship with each other) to acquire professional power practically unheard of for a woman of her time, she also bumps up against barriers to that power. Likewise, MUTUAL INTEREST brilliantly explores the freedom that wealth affords its queer characters --- and the limitations that even wealth can\u2019t overcome.

Etta Shiber and Kate Bonnefous are the unlikeliest of heroines: two seemingly ordinary women, an American widow and an English divorc\u00e9e, living quietly together in Paris. Yet during the Nazi occupation, these two friends find themselves unexpectedly plunged into the whirlwind of history. With the help of a French country priest and others, they set out to rescue British and French soldiers trapped behind enemy lines --- some of whom they daringly smuggle through Nazi checkpoints hidden inside the trunk of their car. Ultimately the Gestapo captures them both. After 18 months in prison, Etta is returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange. Back home, hoping to bring attention to her friend Kitty\u2019s bravery, she publishes a memoir about their work. PARIS-UNDERGROUND becomes a publishing sensation and Etta a celebrity. Meanwhile, Kate spends the rest of the war in a Nazi prison, entirely unaware of the book that has been written about her --- and the deeds that have been claimed in her name. In researching this story, Matthew Goodman uncovered military records and personal testimonies that reveal, for the first time, the shocking truth behind Etta\u2019s memoir and the unexpected, far-reaching consequences of its publication.

For the next five years, Evelyn works full time as a waitress yet remains unable to afford legitimate housing or qualify for government aid. All the while she strives to provide stability, education, loving memories and college aspirations for her children even as they sleep in motels and in her car, living in fear of both her ex and the nation\u2019s largest child welfare agency. Eventually Evelyn encounters Wendi Gaines, a recently trained social worker who decades earlier survived her own abusive marriage and housing crisis. Evelyn becomes one of Wendi\u2019s first clients, and the relationship transforms them both. Told from the perspectives of Evelyn, Wendi, and Evelyn\u2019s teenage son, Orlando, SEEKING SHELTER is a powerful and urgent exploration of the issues of homelessness, poverty and education in America --- a must-read for anyone interested in understanding not just social inequality and economic disparity in our society but also the power of a mother\u2019s love and vision for her kids."

The business triumphs of Bill Gates are widely known: the 20-year-old who dropped out of Harvard to start a software company that became an industry giant and changed the way the world works and lives; the billionaire many times over who turned his attention to philanthropic pursuits to address climate change, global health and U.S. education.\n\t\u00a0\n\tSOURCE CODE is not about Microsoft or the Gates Foundation or the future of technology. It\u2019s the human, personal story of how Bill Gates became who he is today: his childhood, his early passions and pursuits. It\u2019s the story of his principled grandmother and ambitious parents, his first deep friendships and the sudden death of his best friend; of his struggles to fit in and his discovery of a world of coding and computers in the dawn of a new era; of embarking in his early teens on a path that took him from midnight escapades at a nearby computer center to his college dorm room, where he sparked a revolution that would change the world.\n\t\u00a0\n\tBill Gates tells this, his own story, for the first time. Wise, warm and revealing, it\u2019s a fascinating portrait of an American life."

        "review": " A fun, sophisticated illustrated collection of essays that catalogs the simple and not-so-simple pleasures of the eclectic world of candy from the award-winning author of AFTER THE ECLIPSE. With illustrations by Forsyth Harmon. A taxonomy of sweetness, a rhapsody of artificial flavors, and a multi-faceted theory of pleasure, SWEET NOTHINGS is made up of 100 illustrated micro essays organized by candy color, from the red of Pop Rocks to the purple Jelly Bonbon in the Whitman\u2019s Sampler. Each entry is a meditation on taste and texture, a memory unlocked. Everyone\u2019s favorites --- and least favorites --- are carefully considered, including Snickers and Trader Joe\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups, as well as the beloved Good n\u2019 Plenty and Werther\u2019s Originals. An expert guide and exquisite writer, Sarah Perry asks such pressing questions as: Twizzlers or Red Vines? Why are Mentos eaters so maniacally happy? And in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, how could Edmund sell out his siblings for, of all things, Turkish delight? She rejects the dreaded \u201cWhat is your favorite candy?\u201d question and counters: Under what circumstances? The question itself is flawed --- favorite under what circumstances? In what weather? On the road, or at home? In what mood? For candy is inextricably tied to the seasons of our lives. SWEET NOTHINGS moves associatively, touching on pop culture, art, culinary history, philosophy, body image and class-based food moralism. It challenges the very idea of \u201cjunk\u201d food and posits taking pleasure seriously as a means of survival. Sarah Perry\u2019s pure love of candy weaves together elegiac glimpses of her '90s childhood --- and the loss at its center --- with stories of love and desire. Surprisingly smart and frequently funny, SWEET NOTHINGS is a tart and sweet ode to finding small joys where you can. Yes, even in black licorice."

When an unidentified airman falls wounded from the sky, The Choir is plunged into danger, and the survival of the Escape Line itself is threatened. The Escape Line\u2019s collapse would leave thousands stranded. Monsignor Hugh O\u2019Flaherty, its architect and the acknowledged leader of The Choir, broods inside the Vatican, paralyzed by the perils of keeping his Roman underground railroad functioning. Meanwhile, SS Commander Paul Hauptmann has been tasked with destroying the entire operation, and the price of failure is high --- his wife and children are under Gestapo lock-and-key in Berlin. Into this deliriously thrilling melee steps Contessa Giovanna Landini, a reckless, audacious and magnetic member of the Italian Resistance who has the nerve to challenge Hauptmann\u2019s authority.

Margot and Mama have lived by the forest ever since Margot can remember. When Margot is not at school, they spend quiet days together in their cottage, waiting for strangers to knock on their door. Strays, Mama calls them. People who have strayed too far from the road. Mama loves the strays. She feeds them wine and keeps them warm. Then she satisfies her burning appetite by picking apart their bodies. But Mama\u2019s want is stronger than her hunger sometimes. And when a beautiful, white-toothed stray named Eden turns up in the heart of a snowstorm, Margot must confront the shifting dynamics of her family, untangle her own desires, and make her bid for freedom. With this gothic coming-of-age tale, debut novelist Lucy Rose explores how women swallow their anger, desire and animal instincts --- and wrings the relationship between mother and daughter until blood drips from it."

And no one is more sympathetic than a mother whose child faces a life-threatening illness. But what if the mother is the cause of the illness? What if the sympathy is the point? Munchausen by proxy (MBP) has fascinated and horrified both professionals and the general public since this disturbing form of child abuse was first identified. But even as the public has been captivated by these tales of abuse and deception, there remains widespread misinformation and confusion about MBP. Are these mothers unfeeling psychopaths, or sick women who need help? And more important, how can we protect the children whose lives are at stake? THE MOTHER NEXT DOOR offers a groundbreaking look at MBP from an unlikely duo: a Seattle novelist whose own family was torn apart by it, and the Texas detective who has worked on more medical child abuse cases than anyone in the nation. Readers ride along on three high-stakes MPB investigations; through riveting reporting and shocking stories from the family members, friends and doctors caught in the blast zone of these unthinkable acts, a twisted portrait of motherhood and deceit is revealed. With help from some of the top MBP experts in the world, Dunlop and Weber uncover the complex maze of psychological, systemic and cultural issues that compound MBP and offer solutions for how we might find our way out."

Kim and Grant are at a turning point. A couple for 30 years, their \"separate but together\" partnership is running up against the realities of late middle age: Grant\u2019s mother has died, the college where he taught philosophy was shuttered, and their twin girls are grown and gone. Escaping the bitter cold of a Midwestern winter for the hot desert sun of Palm Springs seems as good a solution as any to the more intractable problems they face. When they arrive at Le Desert, a quirky condo community where everyone knows everyone\u2019s business, Kim immediately embraces the opportunity to make new friends and explore a more adventurous side of her personality. Meanwhile, Grant struggles to find his footing in this unfamiliar landscape, leaving Kim to wonder if their relationship can survive the snowbird season. But when Grant goes missing on a hike in the Palm Springs mountains, Kim is forced to consider two terrifying outcomes: either Grant is truly lost, or this time, he\u2019s really left her. Is it ever too late to become the person we wanted to be --- and is there still time to change into someone better? The exhilarating but often confusing transitions of midlife are pitched against the promise and glamour of Palm Springs in this tender, honest story of what it takes to commit to someone for a lifetime. With compassion and humor, Clancy explores the redemptive power of finding ourselves, and of being found."

For 50 years, Abe and Jane have been coming to Central Park, as starry-eyed young lovers, as frustrated and exhausted parents, as artists watching their careers take flight. They came alone when they needed to get away from each other, and together when they had something important to discuss. The Park has been their witness for half a century of love. Until now. Jane is dying, and Abe is recounting their life together as a way of keeping them going: the parts they knew --- their courtship and early marriage, their blossoming creative lives --- and the parts they didn\u2019t always want to know --- the determined young student of Abe\u2019s looking for a love story of her own, and their son, Max, who believes his mother chose art over parenthood and who has avoided love and intimacy at all costs. Told in various points of view, even in conversation with Central Park itself, these voices weave in and out to paint a portrait as complicated and essential as love itself. An homage to New York City, to romance and even to loss, THIS IS A LOVE STORY tenderly and suspensefully captures deep truths about life and marriage in radiant prose. It is about love that endures despite what life throws at us, or perhaps even because of it."

Now, Feito returns with her \u201csilver-polish sentences and her eerie psychological acumen\u201d (Constance Grady, Vox) to unleash an entirely new antihero on us all. Grim Wolds, England: Winifred Notty arrives at Ensor House prepared to play the perfect governess. She\u2019ll dutifully tutor her charges, Drusilla and Andrew, tell them bedtime stories, and only joke about eating children. But long, listless days spent within the estate\u2019s dreary confines come with an intimate knowledge of the perversions and pathetic preoccupations of the Pounds family. Mr. Pounds can\u2019t keep his eyes off Winifred\u2019s chest, and Mrs. Pounds takes a sickly pleasure in punishing Winifred for her husband\u2019s wandering gaze. Compounded with her disdain for the entitled Pounds children, Winifred finds herself struggling at every turn to stifle the violent compulsions of her past. French tutoring and needlework are one way to pass the time, as is admiring the ugly portraits in the gallery...and creeping across the moonlit lawns. Patience. Winifred must have patience, for Christmas is coming, and she has very special gifts planned for the dear souls of Ensor House. Brimming with sardonic wit and culminating in a shocking conclusion, VICTORIAN PSYCHO plunges readers into the chilling mind of an iconic new literary psychopath."

Using her grief and her father\u2019s death as a backdrop, Okokon delves deeply into intrinsic themes of Blackness, African spirituality, family, abandonment, belonging, and the seemingly endless, unrequited romantic pursuits of a Black woman who came of age as a Black girl in the Wisconsin suburbs where she was --- in many ways --- always an anomaly."

To some, Maya represents the American dream. To others, a gold digger. But when Colin's cousin Arianna, the heiress to the family's immense fortune, is found murdered, Maya is thrust into the spotlight: first as she is revealed to be the next heiress to the fortune, and then as the prime suspect. Swiftly, the entire Sterling family goes into lockdown at Silver House, the family's ancestral estate in the English countryside. They're told it's for their own safety --- but Maya becomes convinced that it's not to keep threats out, but to keep secrets in. Now, she has no choice but to find and expose the truth hidden within the Sterling family, and why Arianna, a girl she had never met, chose her to take her place. But Maya has secrets of her own.

In an aging timber house hand-built into the Absaroka-Beartooth mountains, two brothers are struggling to keep up with their debts. They live off the grid, on the fringe of Yellowstone, surviving off the wild after the death of their father. Thad, the elder, is more capable of engaging with things like the truck registration, or the medical bills they can\u2019t afford from their father\u2019s fatal illness, or the tax lien on the cabin their grandfather built, while Hazen is\u2026different, more instinctual, and deeply in tune with the natural world. Desperate for money, they are approached by a shadowy out-of-towner with a dangerous proposition that will change both of their lives forever. BEARTOOTH is a fast-paced tale with moments of surprising poignancy set in the grandeur of the American West. Evoking the timeless voices of American pastoral storytelling, this is a bracing, masterful novel about survival, revenge and the bond between brothers."

Carl manages the area\u2019s swanky and successful spa and hotel, while Roy runs a nearby gas station and harbors grand plans to build it out into an entire amusement park, complete with a roller coaster. But when news breaks about a new highway to be built nearby, bypassing Os and leaving the town cutoff and isolated, it\u2019s clear that something has to be done\u2026even if the methods are bound to be dirty. Fortunately, Carl and Roy have experience with just that kind of work.

And just as the sheriff reopens his investigation, the death toll begins to climb.

Prudence Wright seems to have it all: a loving husband, Davis; a spacious home in Washington, D.C.; and the former glories of a successful career at McKinsey, which now enables her to dedicate her days to her autistic son, Roland. When she and Davis head out for dinner with one of Davis\u2019 new colleagues on a stormy summer evening filled with startling and unwelcome interruptions, Prudence has little reason to think that certain details of her history might arise sometime between cocktails and the appetizer course. Yet when Davis\u2019 colleague turns out to be Matshediso, a man from Prudence\u2019s past, she is transported back to the formative months she spent as a law student in South Africa in 1996. As an intern at a Johannesburg law firm, Prudence attended sessions of the Truth and Reconciliation hearings that uncovered the many horrors and human rights abuses of the Apartheid state, and which fundamentally shaped her sense of righteousness and justice. Prudence experienced personal horrors in South Africa as well, long hidden and now at risk of coming to light. When Matshediso finally reveals the real reason behind his sudden reappearance, he will force Prudence to examine her most deeply held beliefs and excavate inner reserves of resilience and strength. Lauren Francis-Sharma\u2019s previous two novels have established her as a deft chronicler of history and its intersections with flawed humans struggling to find peace in unjust circumstances. With keen insight and gripping tension, CASUALTIES OF TRUTH explosively mines questions of whether we are ever truly able to remove the stains of our past and how we may attempt to reconcile with unquestionable wrongs."

Lingering at the edge of a family party, a troop of cousins loses track of the youngest child among them. With their parents preoccupied with bickering about decades-old crises, the children decide they must set out to investigate themselves --- to the rickety chicken coop, the barn and its two troublesome horses, and into the woods that once comprised their late grandmother\u2019s property. The more the children search, and the deeper they walk, the more threatening the woods become and the more lost they are, caught between their aunt\u2019s home in the present day, their parents\u2019 childhood home just through the trees and the memory of the house their grandmother grew up in. Soon, what began as a quest for answers gives way to a journey that undermines everything they\u2019ve been told about who they are, where they came from and what they deserve. Disquieting and delightful, IDLE GROUNDS is a rich exploration of the interior lives of children and a gripping meditation on birthright, decline and weight of family history. A fable of the distortions of privilege and the impossibility of keeping secrets hidden, this is a novel about straying from home --- only to come back unraveled, unsettled and irrevocably changed."

In 1992 Chicago, Freda\u2019s daughter, Tulip, is an ambitious PR professional on track for an exciting career, if workplace politics and racial microaggressions don\u2019t get in her way. But with the ruling in the Rodney King trial weighing heavily on her, Tulip feels called to action. When she makes an irreversible professional misstep as she seeks to uplift her community, she must decide, just like her mother had three decades prior, what she\u2019s willing to risk in the name of justice and equality. Insightful, evocative and richly imagined with stories of hidden history, PEOPLE OF MEANS is an emotional tour de force that offers a glimpse into the quest for racial equality, the pursuit of personal and communal success, and the power of love and family ties."

Estleman's next enthralling Amos Walker mystery SMOKE ON THE WATER. As the smoke from Canadian wildfires chokes Detroit, PI Amos Walker is tasked with investigating a fatal hit-and-run. The victim is Spencer Bennett, a junior law associate with the Waterford Group, and he supposedly had a file of confidential documents on him when he died. But those documents have now gone missing, and the firm is dead set on Walker finding them. As Walker digs deeper into the events leading to Bennett's death, all signs are pointing towards the crash being anything but accidental. Summer in Detroit was hot enough before the smoke descended, but as the temperature rises and more bodies crop up in connection to the missing file, Walker will have to track down those documents --- and unearth why they were worth killing over --- before it's too late."

Who will become the next prime minister of Italy, and who will be the next pope? Finding answers proves difficult until Cotton realizes that everything hinges on when, and if, the Medici return."

CHRISTIE returns with a thrilling story of Agatha Christie\u2019s legendary rival, Dorothy Sayers; the race to solve a murder; and the power of friendship among women. London, 1930. The five greatest women crime writers have banded together to form a secret society with a single goal: to show they are no longer willing to be treated as second-class citizens by their male counterparts in the legendary Detection Club. Led by the formidable Dorothy L. Sayers, the group includes Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham and Baroness Emma Orczy. They call themselves the Queens of Crime. Their plan? Solve an actual murder, that of a young woman found strangled in a park in France who may have connections leading to the highest levels of the British establishment. May Daniels, a young English nurse on an excursion to France with her friend, seemed to vanish into thin air as they prepared to board a ferry home. Months later, her body is found in the nearby woods. The murder has all the hallmarks of a locked room mystery for which these authors are famous. How did her killer manage to sneak her body out of a crowded train station without anyone noticing? If, as the police believe, the cause of death is manual strangulation, why is there is an extraordinary amount of blood at the crime scene? What is the meaning of a heartbreaking secret letter seeming to implicate an unnamed paramour? Determined to solve the highly publicized murder, the Queens of Crime embark on their own investigation, discovering they\u2019re stronger together. But soon the killer targets Dorothy Sayers herself, threatening to expose a dark secret in her past that she would do anything to keep hidden. Inspired by a true story in Sayers\u2019 own life, New York Times bestselling author Marie Benedict brings to life the lengths to which five talented women writers will go to be taken seriously in the male-dominated world of letters as they unpuzzle a mystery torn from the pages of their own novels."

        "review": " From rare book dealer and guest star of the hit show \"Pawn Stars,\" a page-turning literary adventure that introduces readers to the women writers who inspired Jane Austen --- and investigates why their books have disappeared from our shelves. Long before she was a rare book dealer, Rebecca Romney was a devoted reader of Jane Austen. She loved that Austen\u2019s books took the lives of women seriously, explored relationships with wit and confidence and always allowed for the possibility of a happy ending. She read and reread them, often wishing Austen wrote just one more. But Austen wasn\u2019t a lone genius. She wrote at a time of great experimentation for women writers --- and clues about those women, and the exceptional books they wrote, are sprinkled like breadcrumbs throughout Austen\u2019s work. Every character in NORTHANGER ABBEY who isn\u2019t a boor sings the praises of Ann Radcliffe. The play that causes such a stir in MANSFIELD PARK is a real one by the playwright Elizabeth Inchbald. In fact, the phrase \u201cpride and prejudice\u201d came from Frances Burney\u2019s second novel, CECILIA. The women who populated Jane Austen\u2019s bookshelf profoundly influenced her work; Austen looked up to them, passionately discussed their books with her friends and used an appreciation of their books as a litmus test for whether someone had good taste. So where had these women gone? Why hadn\u2019t Romney --- despite her training --- ever read them? Or, in some cases, even heard of them? And why were they no longer embraced as part of the wider literary canon? JANE AUSTEN'S BOOKSHELF investigates the disappearance of Austen\u2019s heroes --- women writers who were erased from the Western canon --- to reveal who they were, what they meant to Austen and how they were forgotten. Each chapter profiles a different writer including Frances Burney, Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Lennox, Charlotte Smith, Hannah More, Elizabeth Inchbald, Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi and Maria Edgeworth --- and recounts Romney\u2019s experience reading them, finding rare copies of their works and drawing on connections between their words and Austen\u2019s. Romney collects the once-famed works of these forgotten writers, physically recreating Austen\u2019s bookshelf and making a convincing case for why these books should be placed back on the to-be-read pile of all book lovers today. JANE AUSTEN'S BOOKSHELF will encourage you to look beyond assigned reading lists, question who decides what belongs there, and build your very own collection of favorite novels."
